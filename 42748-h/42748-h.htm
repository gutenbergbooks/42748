<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="noi"><i>Dear Boys</i>:</p>

<p>Here we have the second volume of “The
Motor Boys Series,” a line of books relating to the
doings of some bright and up-to-date youths, on
wheels, at home and abroad.</p>

<p>In the first volume of the series, called “The
Motor Boys,” the writer told how Bob, Ned and
Jerry won several important races, including that
which brought to them a much-wished-for prize, a
grand touring car.</p>

<p>The car won, there was nothing to do but to
take a long trip, and in this present book, “The
Motor Boys Overland,” are given the particulars
of a journey in the automobile to the great West.
On the way the boys fall in with an old miner, who
has the secret of a lost gold mine of great value.
The lads decide to take the miner to the lost mine
in their touring car, and the long and perilous
journey among the mountains is begun. Enemies
also hear of the wonderful lost mine, and then
begins a wild race, to see who shall get there first
and claim the riches.</p>

<p>This “Motor Boys Series” will be continued by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
a third volume, to be called “The Motor Boys in
Mexico.” I earnestly hope the boys will find the
stories to their liking. I can assure all it has been
a pleasure to pen them, for the writer is something
of an automobile enthusiast himself, and some of
the experiences on the road have been taken from
life.</p>

<h1>THE MOTOR BOYS OVERLAND.</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br />
<small>AN AUTOMOBILE RACE.</small></h2>


<p>There was a whizz of rubber-tired wheels, a
cloud of dust and the frightened yelping of a dog
as a big, red touring automobile shot down the
road.</p>

<p>“You nearly ran over him, Chunky!” exclaimed
Jerry Hopkins, to the stout youth at his side.</p>

<p>“That’s what you did, Bob Baker!” chimed in
Ned Slade, leaning over from the rear seat of the
auto. “I thought you said you were an expert.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t come within five feet of the pup,” answered
Bob Baker, giving the steering wheel a
twist to avoid a chicken that scooted across the
country road.</p>

<p>“Never mind&mdash;miss as good as a mile&mdash;we certainly
are skating along&mdash;never say die&mdash;hit a dog,
biff! bang! up in the air&mdash;down again&mdash;bust a tire&mdash;break
your leg&mdash;kill the animal&mdash;off again&mdash;whoop!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, Andy Rush, if you’re going to talk as fast
as that the first time Chunky speeds the machine,
I’m going to get out!” cried Jerry, with a laugh.
“There’s excitement enough without you making
any more.”</p>

<p>“All right, fellows, I’ll keep quiet,” agreed
Andy, who was a small, nervous chap, never still
for a moment, and so full of energy that he
talked, as Jerry sometimes said, “like a house
afire.”</p>

<p>Bob leaned forward and pulled one of the
levers. The auto slowed down, as the low-speed
gear came into play, and bowled along under a
stretch of shady trees.</p>

<p>“Fifteen miles in thirty minutes,” remarked the
stout lad, pulling out his watch. “Not so bad for
a starter, eh, Ned?”</p>

<p>“The machine certainly can go!” observed Jerry.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have the full-speed lever on, either,”
remarked Bob, who was called “Chunky” by his
companions, because of his fleshiness. He turned
off the gasolene as the auto came under a large
chestnut tree, and the four boys stretched out comfortably
on the leather-upholstered seats.</p>

<p>There was Bob Baker, a lad of fifteen years, son
of Andrew Baker, a rich banker; Ned Slade, sixteen
years old, the only son of Aaron Slade, a department
store proprietor, and Jerry Hopkins, the
son of a widow, Mrs. Julia Hopkins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>These three were faithful chums, seldom apart.
With them was a mutual friend, Andy Rush. All
the boys lived in the village of Cresville, not far
from Boston.</p>

<p>The three first named had, the week before the
story opens, come into possession of a fine touring
car, which they had won as the first prize of a motor-cycle
meet, given by the Cresville Athletic Club,
as related in the first volume of this series,
entitled “The Motor Boys.”</p>

<p>In that was told how they had incurred the enmity
of Noddy Nixon, a town bully, who had
robbed the mill of Amos Judson of one thousand
dollars, which crime the Motor Boys were instrumental
in fastening on Noddy.</p>

<p>In consequence of the pending disclosure of his
guilt, Noddy had fled from town, a short time before
the races, in his father’s automobile. Bill
Berry, a town ne’er-do-well, accompanied him. Not
long after Noddy had fled in the terror of his guilt
being found out, he sent back a letter threatening
vengeance on the three boys, whom he accused as
being responsible for the fact that he had to leave
home.</p>

<p>But the Motor Boys, as they now called themselves,
cared little for this in view of the pleasures
they anticipated when they got the automobile.
It had come in due time; a fine affair, with all
the latest improvements and attachments, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
was a car capable of making a trip almost
anywhere.</p>

<p>The company from whom the auto was purchased
sent an expert out to Cresville with it, to
instruct the boys in the running of the machine.
They learned readily, and were soon able to make
short trips on the country roads surrounding the
village. This was the first time they had made an
extended trip, and the drawing of lots had given
Bob the chance to drive the auto, with the result
that he nearly came to grief when the dog unexpectedly
ran across the road.</p>

<p>For about half an hour the three chums and
Andy rested in the shade. It was a pleasant fall
afternoon, and though the sun was warm there was
a cool breeze.</p>

<p>“Whose turn to crank her up?” asked Bob, for,
of course, it could not be expected of him, in charge
of the steering wheel, to start the engine.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s mine,” came from Ned, with a sort
of groan. His arm still ached from the previous
turning of the flywheel.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it&mdash;lots of fun&mdash;first time I ever had a
chance&mdash;let me&mdash;good for my muscle&mdash;whoop!”
exclaimed Andy, bustling from the car.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s good for your muscle, all right
enough,” observed Ned. “Go on, I’ll not stop
you.”</p>

<p>It was harder work than Andy had anticipated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
but he managed to give the crank a few turns and
spin the heavy flywheel around. Bob switched on
the spark, turned the gasolene into the cylinders,
and soon there was a throbbing that told the engine
had started. Andy jumped to one side and
nearly toppled over.</p>

<p>“Did you think I’d run you down?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about autos,” answered
Andy.</p>

<p>“She can’t go until I connect the speed-gears,”
explained Bob, with something of a superior air.
“Hop in, Andy!”</p>

<p>Andy climbed back to his rear seat, Bob threw
the lever forward to first speed, and the car, moving
slowly at first, but with increasing swiftness,
started down the road.</p>

<p>“Look out for dogs!” advised Ned.</p>

<p>“We don’t want roast chicken for supper, so
you needn’t bother to kill any,” came from Jerry.</p>

<p>“I can steer as good as either of you,” exclaimed
the stout lad. “You nearly hit a man the
other day, Jerry, and I guess you’ve forgotten,
Ned, how you broke down one of Mr. Smith’s
shade trees. I’m not as bad as that.”</p>

<p>Honk! honk! sounded down the road in the
rear of the boys.</p>

<p>“Here comes another auto,” said Jerry. “Keep
over to one side, Bob.”</p>

<p>Honk! honk! This time it was Bob who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
blew his horn to let the oncomers know some one
was ahead of them. The noise of the approaching
car sounded nearer.</p>

<p>“Better keep well over, Chunky,” advised Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to give ’em more than half the
road,” answered Bob, firmly. “If they want a race
they can have it, too.”</p>

<p>He threw the third-speed clutch into place, and
the boys’ car shot ahead so suddenly that Andy was
nearly toppled out of his seat. The red auto
dashed down the road.</p>

<p>Behind it, at a swift pace, there came a big,
green affair, almost twice the size of the Cresville
machine. It was going at a great pace, a lone man
occupying the steering seat, and no one being in
back. As the green car shot past the red one, the
solitary rider gave three toots to his horn. Bob
answered, and then, before the other boys could
stop him he advanced his spark, turned on more
gasolene, and was away after the green dragon
like a streak of red fire.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” yelled Ned.</p>

<p>“See if I can beat him!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“You’re crazy! That’s a ninety horse-power car
and ours is only forty!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to try,” repeated Bob, between his
clenched teeth.</p>

<p>It looked like a hopeless undertaking. The
green car was a quarter of a mile ahead before Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
could get his machine speeded up. When he
did, however, the new auto ran along swiftly and
easily.</p>

<p>Bob shut off his power temporarily and then,
with a quick yank, pulled the lever to full speed
ahead. Then he turned on the spark and gasolene.
The red auto seemed to double its already swift
motion.</p>

<p>The car swayed from side to side, and the boys,
except Bob, who had a firm grip of the wheel, were
bounced up into the air, again and again. Bob had
on big goggles, and, with head bent low, was watching
the road like a hawk ready to pounce on a
chicken.</p>

<p>“We’re gaining on him!” he muttered, and he
tooted the horn. Back a faint, answering blast
came.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was evident that the red auto, though
a smaller and less powerful machine, was creeping
up on its rival. The lone chauffeur glanced
back, saw the pursuing car, and turned on
full power.</p>

<p>For a few moments he increased his lead. But
Bob advanced his spark further, and turned on a
trifle more of gasolene. The red auto once more
leaped forward.</p>

<p>“We’ve got him!” cried Bob. “He can’t get
another inch out of his, and I haven’t used the accelerator
pedal yet. We’ll beat him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“If we don’t all break our necks!” exclaimed
Jerry, holding to his seat.</p>

<p>“Terrible fast&mdash;takes your breath&mdash;shakes the
liver-pin out of you&mdash;loosens all your teeth&mdash;great
sport&mdash;smash the machine&mdash;never say die&mdash;don’t
give up the ship&mdash;whoop!” yelled Andy, as he slid
down to the bottom of the car, unable any longer
to remain upright.</p>

<p>Slowly the red car crept up on the green one.
The dust arose in clouds about both machines. The
autos swayed from the terrific speed, but Bob held
the wheel firm and was ready to shut off power and
apply the emergency brake in a second. The man
in front again glanced back, and did not seem to
relish being passed by mere boys in a smaller car
than his. He was making desperate efforts to
draw away.</p>

<p>The distance between the machines lessened.
Bob was watching his opportunity.</p>

<p>“Now we’ve got him!” he cried. “Here we
go!”</p>

<p>He pushed down the accelerator pedal, used only
to give a momentary burst of speed. The red car
shot forward and the front wheels almost lapped
the rear ones of the machine in the lead.</p>

<p>There was a slight turn to the road, just where
Bob had decided to pass his rival. A clump of
trees hid the view, excepting for a short distance
ahead. Just as the boys’ auto was on the point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
making the turn and passing the green one, Ned
glanced up and gave a shout of terror.</p>

<p>Right in front was a load of hay, overturned in
the road, and both cars, at full speed, were dashing
straight for it!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />
<small>HO FOR THE WEST!</small></h2>


<p>“Put on the brake!” yelled Ned.</p>

<p>“Shut off the power!” shouted Jerry.</p>

<p>A frightened cry came from the farmer whose
load of fodder had overturned in the road. He
was unhitching his horses, and jumped to one side
as he saw two big autos bearing down on him.</p>

<p>“You’re in for a spill, lads!” called the man in
the green car. At that instant he applied his emergency
brake and shut off the power. His car came
to such a sudden stop that he was thrown from his
seat, high into the air.</p>

<p>Bob seemed unable, from the very terror of
fright, to make a move to stop the auto he was
steering, and clung to the wheel like grim death.</p>

<p>“Put on the brake!” yelled Ned again. “We’ll
be killed!”</p>

<p>The load of hay was not ten feet in advance.
Bob gave the wheel a sudden twist. The red car
shot to one side, out into a ditch along the road. It
skidded on two wheels, the boys were nearly thrown
out, and bounced high in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>With another quick twist, Bob sent the car
straight ahead. Then another turn of the wheel
and he was back in the road again!</p>

<p>He had passed the obstruction, going between
it and the green auto, and had reached the highway
in safety after as daring a bit of steering as ever a
boy undertook. Then he shut off the power and
applied the brakes hard, the car coming to a stop
with a groan and screech as the emergency band
gripped the axle.</p>

<p>“Whew! That was a close shave!” came from
Jerry, as he drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“A little too near for comfort!” was Ned’s
opinion.</p>

<p>“Bet your life!” was all Andy could say, his
rapid fire of words failing to discharge this time.</p>

<p>“I thought it was the only thing to do,” remarked
the stout steersman. “I was afraid to stop
too suddenly, and I figured we just had room
enough to get through. But I wouldn’t do it
again.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of sudden stops, I wonder what has
become of the man in the green car?” spoke Jerry.
“We must go back and find out.”</p>

<p>The four lads leaped from their machine and
ran back past the load of hay. The farmer was
rapidly walking about in a circle, wringing his
hands and crying:</p>

<p>“He’s killed! He’s killed! I know he is!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>With rather anxious hearts the boys hurried
around to the other side of the big pile of dried
grass. As they reached the place they saw a man
attired in an automobile suit, with big goggles on,
wiggle out from the mass of hay. He pulled several
wisps from his hair and then saw the boys.</p>

<p>“Did you shoot right through the pile and come
out on the other side?” he asked.</p>

<p>“We ran around it,” explained Bob. “We beat
you,” he added, not without pride.</p>

<p>“So I see. It came pretty near being the end of
all of us. You’re a plucky lad. I don’t mind being
beaten by you. I thought I had a good car, but
yours is better.”</p>

<p>“Ours is much lighter; I guess that’s why we
went ahead,” returned Jerry, willing to concede
something to a vanquished rival. “But are you
hurt?”</p>

<p>The man carefully felt of different parts of his
body. Then he took off his goggles and looked
over as much as he could see of himself.</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to be,” he said, finally, with a
laugh. “It was like falling into a feather bed to
land in that hay-pile the way I did. That’s all
that saved me. I wonder how my machine stood
the emergency brake.”</p>

<p>He examined his car carefully, and was apparently
satisfied that no injury had been done by the
sudden stopping of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where is he?” asked the farmer, suddenly appearing
from behind the hay. “Is he dead?” And
then he seemed to realize his error and joined in
the laugh that followed.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not dead yet,” replied the owner of
the green car. “Well,” he went on, “I must be
going. Are you boys coming along? If you are,
no more races.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to go back to Cresville,” answered
Bob. “We promised to return for supper.”</p>

<p>The man bade the boys good-by and soon the
big, green dragon was throbbing down the road in
a cloud of dust. The boys, finding they could not
help the farmer in his trouble, got in their machine
and, promising to send help from the first farmhouse
they passed, they left the owner of the hay
and were soon speeding toward Cresville.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this glorious!” exclaimed Jerry, as the
auto sped along. “I wish we could take a long
trip.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t we?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We talked of a tour when we found we had a
chance to get a car,” put in Chunky. “I for one
would like to go out West.”</p>

<p>“Ho for the West!” piped up Andy. “Over
the plains&mdash;herds of cattle&mdash;cowboys in chase&mdash;rattlesnakes
and horned toads&mdash;sandy deserts&mdash;Indians&mdash;bang!
Shoot ’em up! Lots of excitement&mdash;take
me along&mdash;whoop!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Easy!” pleaded Jerry. “One thing at a time,
Andy. Haven’t we had excitement enough for one
day?”</p>

<p>“We ought to make a strike to go on a western
trip, though,” spoke Ned, in serious tones. “Here
we have a car that we could cross the continent in.
Let’s speak about it at home. It can’t do any harm.
Maybe the folks will let us go.”</p>

<p>“It’s worth trying for,” said Jerry. “What do
you say, Chunky?”</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” replied Bob. “It will be the
best sport ever. But wouldn’t we have to wait until
next spring? It’s fall, and if we go West it may
be very cold, with lots of snow soon.”</p>

<p>“We can bear off to the south,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Sure enough,” agreed Chunky.</p>

<p>That night, when the automobile had been safely
put away in the barn at Bob’s house, three anxious
boys broached the subject to their respective parents.
So insistent were they that it was not long
before a general council was arranged. Mrs. Hopkins
and Mr. Slade were induced to call at Mr.
Baker’s house, where, with the three boys, the
whole subject was gone over.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s too much of an undertaking,”
said Mr. Baker.</p>

<p>“That’s my idea,” agreed Mr. Slade, and Mrs.
Hopkins nodded to indicate that that was her view.</p>

<p>The boys set up a chorus of pleadings. The parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
had many objections. The distance was too
great, the boys did not know enough about automobiles,
they would lose their way and break down
far from help. In fact, so many negative reasons
were given that it looked as if the plan would not
go through.</p>

<p>“Will you please wait ten minutes before you
make a final decision?” asked Jerry, appealing to
the trio of parents.</p>

<p>They agreed, wondering what he was about to
do. Jerry got his hat and hurried from Mr.
Baker’s house. In a little while he returned, all
out of breath.</p>

<p>“He’ll be here in five minutes,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Mr. Slade.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wakefield.” Jerry referred to Horace
Wakefield, an instructor at the Athletic Club, who
was quite a friend of the boys, and who himself
had recently purchased an automobile. He lived
near Mr. Baker.</p>

<p>“What’s all this I hear about a trip to the West
these boys are going to take?” asked Mr. Wakefield,
a few minutes later, coming into the parlor
where the conference was going on.</p>

<p>“You mean the trip they think they are going
to take,” corrected Mr. Slade, with a laugh. “I
suppose Jerry told you it was all settled.”</p>

<p>“To be honest, he wanted me to come over and
settle it for him and his chums,” replied the instructor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
“He said there was some doubt about
the feasibility of making the trip.”</p>

<p>Mr. Baker explained how matters stood. He
and the other parents were willing the boys should
have a good time, he said, but did not want them
to run into danger.</p>

<p>“Do you think they could make a trip away out
West in their car?” asked Mr. Baker.</p>

<p>“From what I know of the boys, and from the
build of their car, I have no doubt it could be done
with perfect safety, as far as ordinary conditions
are concerned,” said Mr. Wakefield. “Of course,
there will be some few troubles, but none that
cannot be overcome with a little work. I
think the trip is perfectly possible. In fact,
you know, autos have gone clear across the
continent.”</p>

<p>“Then you think we ought to let the boys go?”
asked Mr. Slade.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;think&mdash;you&mdash;ought to,” replied the instructor,
with purposed deliberateness, smiling at the
anxious lads.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled Bob, forgetting that he was
in the house.</p>

<p>“Lucky I thought to go and get him,” spoke
Jerry to Ned.</p>

<p>“I might add,” went on Mr. Wakefield, “that I
am going to make a trip as far as Chicago. If you
decide to let the boys go, they could accompany me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
that far, at least. It would be a good experience
for them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dad! Please let us go!” pleaded Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” chimed in Jerry and Ned.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, while the parents
were gravely considering the matter. During
it the boys could almost hear the beating of their
own hearts.</p>

<p>“Well,” began Mr. Baker, “I’m willing, if the
rest of you are.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I may as well say yes,” spoke Mr.
Slade.</p>

<p>“Then the only thing left for me to do is to
agree with the majority,” said Mrs. Hopkins, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“Westward ho!” fairly shouted Bob, and he
began to do an impromptu jig until his father
stopped him.</p>

<p>“We’ll take Andy Rush along,” said Ned, “and
we’ll start the first of the week!”</p>

<p>“Hark! What was that?” asked Mr. Baker,
suddenly.</p>

<p>Out on the night air sounded an alarm.</p>

<p>“Fire! Fire! Fire!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />
<small>THE OLD MILL ON FIRE.</small></h2>


<p>They all rushed to windows and looked out into
the night. Off to the north a dull red glare lighted
the sky.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Mr. Baker.</p>

<p>“I can’t see from here,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows! Let’s go!” exclaimed Ned.
He started for the door.</p>

<p>“Take the auto,” suggested Bob. “No telling
how far off it is.”</p>

<p>The next instant the three boys were in the automobile
shed, getting the machine ready for a start.
The red glow in the sky increased. People began
running past on their way to the fire.</p>

<p>There was a clatter and bang, a ringing of bells,
and the one engine the town possessed, in all the
glory of its brass and nickel plate, rushed past, as
fast as the horses could drag it. The hose-cart
followed.</p>

<p>“Hurry up or we’ll miss the fun!” cried Ned to
Bob, who was cranking the auto. Somehow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Chunky could not get the engine started. At last
he succeeded and the boys climbed to their seats.</p>

<p>“It’s my turn to steer!” cried Jerry, and no one
disputed him. He ran the car out of the side path,
past the Baker home. On the stoop stood Mr.
Slade, Mrs. Hopkins and Mr. Baker, watching the
fire.</p>

<p>“Want to come along?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Let’s go,” exclaimed Mr. Slade, and he and
Mr. Baker got their hats and were soon in the
rear seat with Ned. Mrs. Hopkins, with a laugh,
declined the trip. Jerry speeded the car ahead and
soon was chugging on toward the fire, which was
some distance outside of town.</p>

<p>On the road the automobilists passed scores of
men and boys who were running at top speed. In
their excitement many were yelling at the top of
their voices.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Bob of a group of boys.</p>

<p>“The old windmill!” was the answer.</p>

<p>“The place where we found the box Noddy
Nixon stole from Mr. Judson!” cried Jerry, turning
to his companions. “Queer, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe he got his toady, Jack Pender, to set
the place afire so nothing would ever come out
about it,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Hardly,” ventured Jerry. “But what’s the
trouble up ahead?”</p>

<p>In advance could be seen quite a crowd of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in a group about some object. Just then came a
long-drawn-out whistle of a steam engine.</p>

<p>“The fire apparatus is stuck!” cried Ned. “The
horses can’t pull it!”</p>

<p>“I always thought that machine was too heavy
for two horses,” said Mr. Slade.</p>

<p>The auto soon came up to the scene of the
trouble. The fire-engine had sunk deep down in
a rut of the road and, pull as they did, the horses
could not budge it.</p>

<p>“Lay hold of the wheels, boys!” called the
driver of the apparatus. “Everybody give a
hand!”</p>

<p>Willingly enough the crowd tried to aid. But
the roads were soft and the engine was heavy. It
seemed bound to stick fast.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Jerry. “Let us through, will
you? I have an idea!”</p>

<p>The crowd parted, the attention of the men and
boys being attracted from the stranded engine.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Mr. Baker.</p>

<p>“Give ’em a lift,” replied Jerry. “I say, have
you a rope?” the boy called to the driver of the
steamer.</p>

<p>“Yes!” was the reply. “But we need more than
a rope to get out of here.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t! I’ll show you!” shouted Jerry.
He had brought the machine to a halt by throwing
out the gear, but did not stop the gasolene engine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
He quickly fastened the rope to the rear axle of
the auto.</p>

<p>“Now tie the other end to the engine and we’ll
pull you to the fire,” the boy said.</p>

<p>The driver saw the feasibility of the scheme at
once. He unhitched the straining horses, attached
the cable to the pole and gave the word. Jerry
threw on the clutch, there was a tightening of the
rope and slowly but surely the engine was dragged
from the mud hole. Then, once on solid ground,
Jerry put on more speed, and, amid the cheers of
the crowd, he started off at a swift pace, dragging
the engine to the fire.</p>

<p>The hose-cart had gone on ahead and was waiting
for the steamer. Power was soon up in the
apparatus, and soon two streams were directed toward
the mill, which was now a mass of flames.</p>

<p>There was no chance of saving it, such a start
had the fire gained, and, in fact, the loss would be
small if it burned down, but the fire company could
not let slip a chance of going to the blaze. So the
crew continued to squirt water, though most of it
did little good. However, there was plenty of excitement,
which suited the boys.</p>

<p>Those in the auto watched the old mill gradually
being consumed. To the boys it brought a
recollection of the time they had there made the
final discovery of Noddy Nixon’s villainy, and had
practically forced him to admit his guilt. At last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the roof fell in, with a big shower of sparks, and
the fire was practically out, though the steamer continued
to pump water.</p>

<p>“Let’s go home,” suggested Mr. Baker. “We’ve
seen enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh, stay a while longer!” pleaded his son. “It’s
a fine moonlight night and it will be fun going
home later.”</p>

<p>“You boys can stay if you like,” said the banker,
“but home’s the place for me, eh, Mr. Slade?”</p>

<p>The merchant agreed. So Jerry turned the auto
toward Cresville and made a quick run, leaving
Mr. Baker and Mr. Slade at their respective
homes, and then he and the boys came back in the
machine to the fire. They found most of the crowd
gone, and the engine about to return to quarters.</p>

<p>“Do you want us to trail along and pull you
again if you get stuck?” asked Bob of the engineer.</p>

<p>“Well, you might come in handy,” was the answer.
“We’re much obliged to you, boys.”</p>

<p>“Glad we were on deck,” said Jerry. “However,
I guess you will not need us again,” and he
sent the auto ahead at a good speed. “We’ll take a
little ride before we go home,” he added to his
chums.</p>

<p>It was a bright moonlight night, rather warm
for the close of September, and the road was a
fairly good one, so the boys skimmed along, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
thoughts on the western trip they were soon to
make. For several miles they kept on. Suddenly
Jerry yanked the levers and put on the brakes.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Bob, as the auto
came to a stop.</p>

<p>“There,” replied Jerry, pointing ahead.</p>

<p>The boys looked and saw, a little in advance, a
tumble-down hut, from the window of which a
light gleamed.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” observed Jerry.</p>

<p>“What is, to see a light in a hut?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“No; but in that particular one,” replied Jerry.
“I came past there day before yesterday and I
noticed that the place is almost ready to fall apart.
No one can be living in it, and any one who is there
at night with a light is there for no good purpose.”</p>

<p>“Let’s take a look,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry shut off the power, took out the spark
plug and the boys advanced cautiously, leaving the
machine on one side of the road.</p>

<p>“Maybe there are tramps in there who won’t
like being spied on,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Don’t make any noise,” was Jerry’s answer.
“Be ready to run when I give the word.”</p>

<p>On tiptoes the boys drew near the hut. Suddenly
Bob grabbed Jerry by the arm.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Smell that?”</p>

<p>“Acetylene gas! Some one has been here with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
a gas lamp, and within a few minutes,” agreed
Jerry, sniffing the peculiar odor.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a motor cycle leaning against the
building?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure enough!” said Jerry. “Go slow, boys.”</p>

<p>Walking like cats, they reached the window
from which the light streamed. As they glanced
inside they saw a sight that startled them.</p>

<p>Lying on a pile of rags in one corner of the
bare room, in the glare of a candle, was an old
man, with matted and unkempt hair and beard.
His face showed pain and suffering. His clothes
were old and ragged. But what attracted the attention
of the boys was the fact that he wore about
his waist a wide leather belt, with several compartments
or pockets in it. The pockets were open
and in them, as well as scattered on the floor in
front of the man, were little piles of yellow, gleaming
gold.</p>

<p>“He’s a miner!” whispered Bob, hoarsely.</p>

<p>As the boys watched they heard the old man
moan:</p>

<p>“Don’t rob me! Don’t take what little I have
left! If I wasn’t sick and suffering no one would
dare play this trick on Jim Nestor!”</p>

<p>The next instant the boys heard a sound from
the farther corner of the room. Out of the semi-darkness
came a figure. It stooped over the old
miner. There was the sound of a blow, a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
groan&mdash;and then came darkness as the candle was
extinguished.</p>

<p>Some one ran rapidly from the hut.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” called the miner, feebly. “Help!
He’s robbed me!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />
<small>A CHASE AFTER A RASCAL.</small></h2>


<p>“After him!” cried Jerry. “Catch the miserable
thief!”</p>

<p>“You and Bob chase him, whoever he is!” called
Ned. “I’ll stay with the old miner here in the hut.
He may be badly hurt.”</p>

<p>“Hurry back to the auto!” shouted Jerry. “We
can catch the thief in that.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he looked ahead. A dark figure
crossed the patch of moonlight in the rear of the
hut. Then came a sound of a motor-cycle being
started, and soon the chug-chug of the machine on
the road told that the thief was escaping that way.</p>

<p>Jerry and Bob ran to the auto. In a trice Jerry
had the engine cranked up. Bob jumped in, followed
by his companion, and they put off down the
road after the fleeing motor-cyclist, whom the
moonlight plainly revealed.</p>

<p>“He can’t get away from us!” exclaimed Jerry.
“We will overhaul him in a jiffy!”</p>

<p>But Jerry reckoned without knowing who he
was after. He did not dare put on full speed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
while the cyclist rashly had his machine going as
fast as the explosions could follow one after the
other. Besides, the thief had a good start with
his light apparatus.</p>

<p>But Jerry determined to make the capture. He
threw in the second speed gear and in a little while
had lessened the distance between the auto and the
motor-cycle.</p>

<p>“I wonder who it is?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can tell,” answered his chum. Jerry
switched on the searchlight in the front of the auto.
A dazzling pencil of illumination shot down the
road.</p>

<p>In the white glare the figure of the motorist
stood out sharply, and the red motor he rode could
be plainly seen. At the sight both boys gave a
start.</p>

<p>“Jack Pender!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“As sure as guns!” cried Jerry. “We must
catch him!”</p>

<p>He was about to take chances and put on the
third gear, when Pender, on his cycle, suddenly
turned from the main road, and took a path leading
through the fields.</p>

<p>“That ends it!” exclaimed Jerry. “No use trying
to follow him. Our auto isn’t built for ’cross-country
riding.”</p>

<p>He slowed up, turned around, and, with a last
glance in the direction Noddy Nixon’s former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
toady and friend had taken, sent the car back toward
the lonely hut.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ned, after his companions had
started on the chase, had struck a match and
lighted the candle in the cabin. He found the old
miner, for such the boys correctly guessed him to
be, lying unconscious in a corner. The belt, with
the gold-dust was gone, though a few grains of the
precious metal were scattered over the floor. Ned
found a pail of water in the place. He bathed the
old man’s head and poured some of the fluid down
his throat.</p>

<p>“Where am I? What happened?” asked the
old man, opening his eyes. Then he passed his
hand over his head. His fingers were stained with
blood.</p>

<p>“You’re all right,” spoke Ned. “I’ll take care
of you. What’s your name and where did you come
from?”</p>

<p>“Don’t let him rob me!” pleaded the old miner.
“I have only a little gold, but I need it. I know
where there is more, much more. I’ll tell you, only
don’t hit me again. I’m sick, please don’t strike
poor Jim Nestor!”</p>

<p>“No one is going to hurt you,” said Ned, in
soothing tones, but the old man did not seem to
comprehend. Ned felt of the miner’s head, and
found he had a bad cut on the back. He washed it
off with some water and bound his handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
around it. This seemed to ease the old man, and
he sank into a doze.</p>

<p>“Well, of all the queer adventures, this is about
the limit,” spoke Ned, to himself.</p>

<p>The boy glanced about the hut. There was
nothing to throw any light on the strange happenings.
The candle flickered in the draught from
the open door, and cast weird shadows. The man
breathed like a person in distress. Ned was about
to bathe the wounded man’s head again, when the
sound of the automobile returning was heard.</p>

<p>“What luck?” asked Ned, running to the door.
“Did you get him?”</p>

<p>Whereupon Jerry told of the fruitless chase
after Jack Pender. The three boys entered the
hut, and Ned told his chums what he had done to
relieve the miner.</p>

<p>“He’s got a bad wound on the head,” he went
on. “I guess Pender must have hit him. Jack
probably came this way, saw the old man in here
sick, and unable to help himself, and watched his
chance to rob him. There must have been considerable
gold-dust in that belt.”</p>

<p>Jerry stooped down and gathered a little from
the floor.</p>

<p>“There is some mystery here,” he said. “I think
we had better get a doctor for the old miner. After
he gets better he may talk. I’d like to get my
hands on Pender for a little while.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“So would I,” chorused Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>“The question is, shall we take the old man
back in the auto with us, or run back to town and
bring out a doctor?” went on Jerry.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better go get a doctor and fetch
him here,” was Ned’s opinion. “It might injure
the old man to move him.”</p>

<p>This was voted the best plan. They made the
unconscious miner as comfortable as possible on
the bed of rags, placed the pail of water where he
could reach it, and prepared to run back to town.
Ned volunteered to stay with the miner until they
returned, but Jerry advised against it, as the hut
was on a lonely road.</p>

<p>It did not take long to reach Cresville. Dr.
Morrison was routed out of bed by the boys, and
agreed to return with them in the auto, when the
case had been explained to him.</p>

<p>“Just wait until I get dressed,” he said, “and
pack up some instruments and I’ll be with you.”</p>

<p>While waiting, Jerry examined the auto to see
that there was plenty of water and gasolene in the
tanks. He found everything all right.</p>

<p>While Dr. Morrison was making ready to relieve
the sufferings of the miner in the hut, Jack
Pender, on his motor-cycle, was still speeding on,
to get as far away as possible from those in pursuit
of him. When he turned from the road and cut
across lots he thought very likely that the auto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
would not follow. But he was taking no chances,
and, when he emerged into the highway again,
about a mile farther on, he still ran his machine at
full speed.</p>

<p>“That was a close call!” he exclaimed. “Who
would ever have thought that those boys, the same
ones who made all the trouble for Noddy, would
be after me! I escaped just in time. I hope I
didn’t kill the old man, though it was a hard blow
I struck him!”</p>

<p>Pender slowed down his machine and listened.
No sound of pursuit came to him on the quiet night
air. He stopped alongside of the road, under a
big oak tree.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll light up and see how I made out,”
he said to himself. He lighted his acetylene lamp
and, standing in the glare of it, drew from his
pocket the belt he had stolen from the old miner.</p>

<p>“Feels heavy,” he muttered. “Ought to be
plenty of gold in it. Well, I need the money if I
am to join Noddy. I must read his letter again.”</p>

<p>He pulled out a sheet of paper and began glancing
over it.</p>

<p>“Dated New York,” he said. “He says he’s
having lots of fun and no end of larks with Bill
Berry. I don’t care much for Bill, myself. He
never was any good around town, and he’s a desperate
man. Hum! let’s see!” He turned to the
letter again. “‘Come and join me, Jack. We’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
go West and have a good time. Bring some money.’
Well, I’ve got the money, all right. Now to start
West. I’ll ride the motor as far as the depot and
take a train.”</p>

<p>Replacing the letter and the belt of gold in his
pockets, Pender remounted his machine and started
off down the road, dark shadows from the trees
soon hiding him.</p>

<p>It was just about this time that Dr. Morrison
had completed his preparations to visit the injured
miner. The physician took a seat in the
auto beside Bob, Ned and Jerry being in front, the
latter steering.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t go too fast,” cautioned the doctor
to Jerry. “You know I’m an old-fashioned man,
and not used to making professional visits any faster
than my horse, old Dobbins, can take me. I
don’t want an upset.”</p>

<p>Jerry promised to be cautious. The moon had
begun to go down, and it was no easy task steering
along the shadowy road, but the boy managed it,
and soon the deserted hut was reached.</p>

<p>“Now to see what sort of a case I have,” spoke
the doctor.</p>

<p>“I’ll bring one of the oil lamps,” said Jerry, unfastening
a lantern from the dashboard, after stopping
the automobile engine. “You can see to work
by it.”</p>

<p>The boys and Dr. Morrison entered the hut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Jerry held the lamp up high to illuminate the
place.</p>

<p>“Now I’m ready,” announced the physician.
“Where is the patient?” and he opened his medical
case.</p>

<p>In wonderment the boys gazed around the hut.
To their astonishment, there was not the slightest
sign of the wounded miner. He had disappeared!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />
<small>THE MYSTERY OF THE MINER.</small></h2>


<p>“He’s gone!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Are you sure he was here?” inquired the physician.</p>

<p>Of that the boys had not the slightest doubt, and
they speedily convinced the medical man. The lantern
was flashed in every corner of the hut, but
there was not a sign of the miner.</p>

<p>“It’s rather queer,” commented Dr. Morrison,
when he had listened to the details the boys gave
him.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose some one came and carried him
off?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“More likely he was not as badly hurt as you
supposed,” replied Dr. Morrison. “He may have
been only stunned by a blow on the head. When
he regained his senses he probably feared another
attack, and so he hurried from the hut. Let me
take the lamp.”</p>

<p>The physician flashed the lantern outside the
door of the cabin, holding it close to the ground.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” he said. “See, there are a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
grains of the gold-dust showing on the door sill,
and here are more, farther along the path. The
man has gone away, and has left a little golden
trail.”</p>

<p>The physician attempted to follow it, but the
yellow specks soon disappeared and there was no
other clew.</p>

<p>“Depend on it, he has run away in fear,” said
the doctor. “Rather disappointing, too. I believe
he could tell a queer story. Who robbed him, I
wonder?”</p>

<p>“It was&mdash;&mdash;” began Bob, but a nudge from
Jerry stopped him.</p>

<p>“We saw some one run from the hut,” explained
Jerry. “We gave chase in the automobile, but the
fellow cut across lots and we couldn’t follow.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I may as well go back,” announced
the doctor. “There is no use staying here. I don’t
believe the miner will return and solve the mystery
for us.”</p>

<p>The auto was turned toward Cresville and a
quick trip was made, the boys speculating among
themselves on what might be revealed if the
wounded man could be found.</p>

<p>The physician was left at his home, and then
the boys began thinking of their beds, as it was
growing late.</p>

<p>“Queer that both Noddy and Jack should turn
thieves, isn’t it?” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“And that we should happen to be mixed up in
both cases,” put in Ned. “I wonder if we will
meet either of them again.”</p>

<p>If the boys could have looked into the future
they would have seen that they were destined to
soon encounter Noddy and Jack, and under the
strangest of circumstances.</p>

<p>The auto was put away and three tired boys
were soon snoring in their beds. They were up
bright and early the next morning and in
consultation about the proposed trip to Chicago.
They called on Mr. Wakefield to learn his
plans.</p>

<p>He said he expected to start for the Windy City
by way of New York, on Thursday. It was then
Tuesday, and the boys realized that they had little
time to spare in which to make their preparations.</p>

<p>The three parents, who had somewhat reluctantly
given their consent to the project, were soon
almost as enthusiastic as the boys. Stocks of clothing
were looked over, money matters were arranged,
and the boys packed their dress-suit cases
with what they thought would do them on the trip.
They were each given a fairly liberal allowance of
funds.</p>

<p>Then the automobile was got ready. It was
given a thorough overhauling, and an extra supply
of tools, together with a full new set of tires, was
provided. Andy Rush was told to prepare to go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
it having been decided to take him as far as New
York or Chicago, he having relatives in both cities.</p>

<p>At last the time came to start. It was a fine,
crisp September morning, and the boys were up
early enough to see the sun rise. The suit-cases
had been strapped to the machine, tires were
pumped up, there was plenty of water and gasolene
in the tanks, the batteries were renewed, and
every bit of machinery had been gone over carefully.
Andy Rush, the night previous, had sent his
things over to Bob’s house, from whence the trip
was to be begun. Andy himself arrived right after
breakfast.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” he shouted. “Here we go&mdash;all
aboard&mdash;blow the horn&mdash;get out of the way&mdash;turn
on the gasolene&mdash;off brakes&mdash;break the records&mdash;mile
a minute&mdash;whoop!”</p>

<p>“You’ll have all the excitement you want for
once, I hope, Andy,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Betcherlife!” exclaimed Andy, in one breath.</p>

<p>The boys piled into the auto; good-byes were
called, over and over again. Then came a toot of
a horn as Mr. Wakefield came up the road in his
machine, a friend, who intended making the trip,
accompanying him.</p>

<p>“All ready, boys?” he called.</p>

<p>“All ready!” replied Jerry, who was going to
steer for the first stage.</p>

<p>With a blaring of the automobile trumpets, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
waving of hands from those who had gathered to
see the start, and a chorus of cries, wishing every
one good luck, the little party rode away.</p>

<p>Mr. Wakefield, who knew the road better than
did the boys, took the lead. His car was of the
same pattern as theirs and both machines were of
equal speed. For several miles the two autos
puffed along over the pleasant country roads.</p>

<p>No attempt to make time was tried, and at noon
the travelers found themselves in Providence,
Rhode Island, that being the first stopping place
Mr. Wakefield had decided on. The machines
were run up in front of a quiet but good hotel, and
every one was hungry enough to do full justice to
the meal.</p>

<p>“How do you boys like it?” asked Mr. Wakefield
at the table. “Do you think you can stand
it as far as Chicago?”</p>

<p>They were all sure they could run the machine
to San Francisco, if necessary, and Mr. Wakefield
and his friend laughed at their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“We have come about seventy miles without a
mishap,” said Mr. Wakefield, “but there are many
miles ahead of us yet.”</p>

<p>After a short rest the journey was again taken
up, and throughout the afternoon the autos were
speeded along. The way was through a pleasant
country, and the boys enjoyed the scenery and
fresh air. Several times they stopped at farmhouses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to get drinks of cold milk, and once a
motherly-looking woman filled the boys’ pockets
with newly baked doughnuts that were
delicious.</p>

<p>“We’ll spend the night in Norwich, Conn.,”
said Mr. Wakefield, when the two autos
were ready to start, after a momentary stop at
a farmhouse.</p>

<p>“Norwich&mdash;Norwich! I know Norwich!” exclaimed
Andy. “I saw it in a book once&mdash;years
ago&mdash;I was a little fellow&mdash;man in the moon came
down too soon to inquire the way to Norwich&mdash;went
by the south&mdash;burnt his mouth&mdash;eating cold
bean porridge!”</p>

<p>“You remember your nursery rhymes well,”
said Mr. Wakefield, with a laugh, in which all
joined.</p>

<p>On and on chugged the autos. The afternoon
waned to dusk and frequent signboards told that
the distance from Norwich was constantly lessening.
Mr. Wakefield was about half a mile in advance,
on a straight, level road. Suddenly came
a sound as of a pistol shot.</p>

<p>“Tire busted!” exclaimed Jerry, shutting off the
power. Mr. Wakefield heard the noise and turned
back.</p>

<p>“Accident?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Jerry explained that one of their inner tubes had
blown out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Want any help?” asked the athletic instructor.</p>

<p>“We may as well begin now as any other time to
mend our own breaks,” spoke Jerry. “You go
ahead. We’ll catch up to you soon.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Mr. Wakefield. He felt that
it would be a good thing to accustom the boys to
depend on themselves. So, telling them that the
road to Norwich was now a straight one, and that
the town was about ten miles off, he left them to
their own devices.</p>

<p>The boys started in on the not very easy task of
taking off the heavy outer shoe and inserting a new
inner tube, of which they carried a supply. It finally
became so dark that they had to light the
lamps to see to work. At length they were finished
and the tools were put away.</p>

<p>The new tire was pumped up and the engine
started. The boys took their seats, and, at Bob’s
request, he was allowed to steer.</p>

<p>“Go slow at first,” advised Jerry, “until we see
how the new tube holds.”</p>

<p>Bob started off at first speed. It was now quite
dark, but the oil and acetylene lamps gave a good
light. All at once Bob, who was peering ahead,
shut off the power with a jerk and put the brakes
on hard.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Something in the road,” replied the steersman,
pointing to a dark object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The next instant three figures loomed up in the
glare of the auto lamps.</p>

<p>“Climb out of that gasolene gig!” exclaimed a
rough voice. “We’re hard up an’ we need help!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />
<small>A HOLD-UP.</small></h2>


<p>“Who are you?” asked Jerry, boldly.</p>

<p>“Never mind who we are!” exclaimed the same
voice. “Just git out of that choo-choo wagon an’
hand over what spare change you have.”</p>

<p>“Is this a hold-up?” demanded Ned.</p>

<p>“If it isn’t it’s a good imitation of one,” was
the answer, accompanied by a laugh. “Come, now!
Look lively!”</p>

<p>One of the men came around to the side of the
auto and grabbed Bob by the arm. At the same
time another of the tramp trio attempted to seize
Jerry. Ned was in the rear seat.</p>

<p>“Let go of me!” exclaimed Jerry, striking at
the man who had climbed up on the step of the
machine. The boy’s blow fell on the man’s arm.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s your game, is it?” cried the ruffian.
He drew back his fist as though to fell Jerry.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” yelled Bob. He was being pulled
from the car by the tramp who had grabbed him.
It looked bad for the Motor Boys.</p>

<p>Ned sprang up from the rear. He had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
fumbling in a valise on the floor of the tonneau.
He leaned forward over the front seat. In each
hand he held some object, bright and shining, and
he aimed them full in the faces of the two tramps
on either side of the auto.</p>

<p><a href="#image02">“Take that!” Ned cried.</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="image02" name="image02"><img src="images/image02.jpg" width="600" height="385"

     title="“TAKE THAT!” NED CRIED." /></a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_43">“TAKE THAT!” NED CRIED.</a></div>
</div>

<p>There was a sharp, hissing sound, a click, and
the air was filled with a pungent odor.</p>

<p>“I’m killed! He’s blinded me!” yelled the
tramp, who had grabbed Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! My head is blown off!” yelled the
other ruffian.</p>

<p>Both of them toppled from the steps of the auto
and rolled over and over in the road, screaming
with pain and fright.</p>

<p>“And there’s one for you!” shouted Ned, taking
aim at the tramp in front of the machine, and
once more the hissing sound was heard.</p>

<p>“Wow!” cried the fellow, and, whirling around,
he dashed off, full speed, down the road.</p>

<p>“Bully for you! Hit ’em again&mdash;knock ’em out&mdash;smash&mdash;bang&mdash;never
say die&mdash;hear ’em yell&mdash;do
it again&mdash;siss&mdash;boom&mdash;ah! Whoop!” cried
Andy, standing on the seat and waving his cap.</p>

<p>The two tramps who had fallen to the road got
up, and, still yelling in pain, followed their companion.</p>

<p>“Start off!” exclaimed Ned to Bob. “I guess
they won’t bother us again very soon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“What in the world did you do to them?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Used an ammonia squirt-gun on each one,” said
Ned.</p>

<p>He showed the boys two affairs that looked like
small revolvers, only the ammunition was liquid
spirits of ammonia, quite strong, contained in a
rubber bulb in the handle. By pressing the bulb
a fine stream of ammonia could be shot for quite
a distance.</p>

<p>“I saw ’em advertised in a magazine,” said Ned.
“They were just the things for vicious dogs and
men, it said, for they blind a person temporarily
and make his face smart like sixty, but no permanent
injury is done. I had ’em in my valise and I
just happened to think of them when those chaps
held us up.”</p>

<p>“Lucky you did,” commented Jerry. “I thought
we were surely going to be robbed.”</p>

<p>“I guess they thought they were killed when
they felt that ammonia,” said Bob. “Ned, you’re
all right, that’s what you are!” he finished,
heartily.</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better move along, or Mr. Wakefield
may be worried about us,” suggested Jerry.</p>

<p>So Bob threw the gear into place and the machine
moved away. No further sign of the tramps
was seen, and the boys reached Norwich without
further incident. They found the hotel Mr. Wakefield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
had arranged to meet them at, and soon were
eating a good supper. The adventure with the
tramps was related, and Mr. Wakefield congratulated
the boys on their pluck.</p>

<p>An early start was had next morning and good
progress was made, so that by noon the travelers
were in Waterbury, Conn., where dinner was eaten.
Mr. Wakefield said that by swift traveling New
York could be reached late that night, but he did
not advise it. Instead, the night was spent in
Danbury.</p>

<p>By noon the next day more than half the distance
between their last stopping place and New York
had been covered, and late that afternoon found
the two autos speeding down Riverside Drive, leading
to the metropolis. Not an accident had occurred
since the hold-up by the tramps and the blowing out
of the tire on the boys’ auto, and each one was congratulating
himself that the trip was being made
under the best of luck.</p>

<p>The travelers were about opposite Grant’s tomb,
and were moving along slowly, when suddenly,
with a noise like a shot, one of Mr. Wakefield’s
tires burst. A young woman, driving a spirited
horse, was passing his auto at the time, and the
animal, taking fright, took the bit in his teeth and
bolted.</p>

<p>The young woman screamed in fright, lost her
hold on the reins and clung desperately to the seat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
There were no vehicles on the drive in that
vicinity just then, excepting the two autos and the
runaway.</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried Mr. Wakefield to the boys, as he
brought his machine to a stop. “Take after her!
There may be an accident! I can’t go on until I
mend this break!”</p>

<p>Ned was steering, and made a turn. Like a
flash he threw on the third gear and the auto
sprang forward like an unleashed hound. Bob,
Andy and Jerry clung to the seats, while Ned
steered the machine after the runaway horse.</p>

<p>The animal was now galloping at top speed, but
the auto was creeping up on him. It made scarcely
a sound, only a purring as the cylinders exploded,
one after another.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Jerry. “Go
close enough so one of us can jump in the carriage?”</p>

<p>“Watch!” was all Ned replied.</p>

<p>Faster and faster went the auto. At length it
passed the galloping steed, and the boys could see
the young woman clinging in desperation to the
seat. Then, as Ned steered the machine ahead of
the horse, the boys saw what his plan was.</p>

<p>The animal was now directly behind the auto,
coming on like the wind. Ned gave one glance
back. Then he quickly threw the gears to first
speed. So quickly was it done that the horse nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
rammed his nose into the rear of the tonneau. The
animal did not think of dashing to one side and so
passing the car. Instead he kept his place behind
it.</p>

<p>Then Ned shut off the power and allowed the
machine to drift along. The horse, seeing the obstruction
continually in front of him, gradually reduced
his speed, and finally, when the auto came to
a stop, the animal did likewise.</p>

<p>Jerry jumped from his seat and, running back,
grasped the bridle. He spoke soothingly to the
animal, and soon had him quieted. The young
woman, pale and trembling, regained her composure.</p>

<p>“I’m so much obliged to you,” she said. “Really,
I don’t know what possessed Dexter. He never
was frightened at autos before. I’m a little
ashamed of myself, too. I ought to have kept hold
of the reins and I could have managed him.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you will be all right now?” asked
Jerry. “If not, one of us will go with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can take care of him now,” replied the
lady. “Dexter will be all right. I thank you boys
very much,” she added, sweetly, and a moment
later drove off.</p>

<p>The boys turned the auto around and speeded
back to where they had left Mr. Wakefield. He
had repaired the break in the tire in the meanwhile
and was ready to proceed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>In a short time the travelers steered for the
hotel, uptown, where Mr. Wakefield had engaged
rooms for all. The machines were sent to a garage,
and the boys prepared to wash up for supper.
It was getting quite dark, and the electric lights in
the streets were gleaming. Jerry was looking from
the window of the sitting-room of the suite which
the boys had on the third floor.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a start and cried:</p>

<p>“There he goes!”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon!” replied Jerry, dashing from
the room.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />
<small>A FRUITLESS PURSUIT.</small></h2>


<p>For a few seconds the other boys did not know
whether Jerry was joking or in earnest. But when
he did not return in a little while they knew he must
have meant what he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything of Noddy,” spoke Ned,
looking out of the window whence Jerry had spied
their enemy.</p>

<p>“It’s getting too dark to see anything,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess if Jerry said he saw Noddy he
meant it,” put in Andy. “I hope he catches him
and gives him a good thrashing!”</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” exclaimed Mr. Wakefield at that
instant, entering their room, “are you all ready
for supper?”</p>

<p>“We are,” answered Ned.</p>

<p>“Where is Jerry?” asked the athletic instructor,
looking around.</p>

<p>“He went out for a little while,” replied Ned,
quickly, not wishing to state Jerry’s real errand.
“I guess he’ll be back in a short time.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know his way around New York;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
I hope he will not get lost,” spoke Mr. Wakefield.</p>

<p>“Trust Jerry to find his way back,” said Ned.</p>

<p>Then the party went down to supper without
waiting for the missing member. Meanwhile,
Jerry was in hot pursuit of Noddy.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he is doing in New York?”
thought Jerry, as he jumped into an elevator that
was just going down, and got out on the ground
floor.</p>

<p>The boy ran out into the street and glanced in
the direction he had seen Noddy taking. The
thoroughfare was not crowded, and, though it was
getting quite dark, Jerry caught a glimpse of
Noddy’s back.</p>

<p>“I’ll catch him and ask him what he meant about
that note he wrote, threatening to get even with
us,” he thought, as he hurried on.</p>

<p>Noddy had quite a start, and Jerry had some
difficulty in getting close to him. He lost a little
time at a street crossing, where there were a number
of vehicles, and Noddy got farther ahead.
Jerry broke into a run when he saw a passage, and
hurried on.</p>

<p>Noddy happened to glance back just as Jerry
passed beneath an electric light, and seeing he was
pursued, started forward at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>The pursuit was getting hot. They had passed
from a busy part of the city and were on a street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
containing only old buildings. There were less
people, too, and Jerry had a good view of Noddy.</p>

<p>Suddenly Noddy turned, shook his fist, and disappeared
into a dilapidated tenement house, which
he was in front of at the time. With a cry, Jerry
bounded forward. As he entered the hallway he
bumped into a roughly dressed man, as he could
see by the dim light of a lamp suspended at the
rear end of the passage.</p>

<p>“Now, then, wot’s all this rush about?” demanded
the man.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Jerry, halting.</p>

<p>“Be you the doctor?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“The doctor? No. Why?”</p>

<p>“’Cause he’s took bad, an’ we’ve sent fer the
doctor. I t’ought you was him.”</p>

<p>“Who’s sick?” inquired the boy, forgetting
for the moment what had brought him to the
place.</p>

<p>“He’s an old miner. I don’t know him, but he
come to me, sick an’ dead broke, an’ I let him sleep
in my room. He’s off his trolley, I guess, but he
says his name is Jim Nestor.”</p>

<p>“Jim Nestor!” exclaimed Jerry. He remembered
that was the name of the miner in the hut,
whom Pender had robbed.</p>

<p>“That’s the name he gave.”</p>

<p>“Off his trolley?” went on the youth, wondering
what form of disease that was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yep. Nutty, you know; bug-house, wheels,
crazy, if that suits you better.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” replied Jerry, understanding.</p>

<p>“If you ain’t the doc. no use of me wastin’ my
time on you,” the man went on. “I’ll have to
chase out after one.”</p>

<p>“I saw the sign of a doctor’s office a little way
back on this street as I came along,” volunteered
the boy. “I’ll go and stay with the man while
you run there.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you!” said the man. “Some of the
people in this house is afraid of him ’cause he talks
in his sleep. You’ll find him on the second floor
front.”</p>

<p>Jerry went up. In a dimly lighted room he saw
an old man lying on a bed, covered with ragged
quilts. One glance showed Jerry that the man was
the miner who had mysteriously disappeared from
the hut when they sought to aid him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sick man opened his eyes. He
looked sharply at Jerry and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve come back, have you? Where is
the boy who took my gold?”</p>

<p>“He got away,” explained Jerry, realizing that
the sick man was in his right senses, for a time
at least.</p>

<p>“I remember you,” went on the miner. “You
and some other boys helped me after I was struck.
You left me alone in the cabin. I was afraid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
one who took my gold would come back, so I
crawled out. The air made me feel better. I
walked to the railroad, got on a freight train, and
came here. Then I got sick again.</p>

<p>“Gold! gold! gold!” exclaimed the miner, suddenly.
“I see it all around. Millions and millions
of it! There is gold for all of us! Do not rob
me!”</p>

<p>Jerry knew the man was wandering again. Just
then the doctor came in and Jerry, after promising
to come back, hurried around to the hotel, where
he found his friends worried over his absence. He
explained about his chase and the finding of the
mysterious miner.</p>

<p>“Did you catch Noddy?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“I forgot all about him when I saw Nestor,” replied
Jerry. “I guess Noddy got away, all right,
probably out of a back door.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do about the miner?”
asked Mr. Wakefield, after supper.</p>

<p>“I’d like to befriend him if we could,” said
Jerry. “He seems like an honest man.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go around and see him,” remarked the athletic
instructor. “Perhaps we can arrange to do
something for him.”</p>

<p>It was quite late that night when Mr. Wakefield
returned from his visit to Jim Nestor. He
found the boys up waiting for him.</p>

<p>“It’s a queer story,” said Mr. Wakefield. “Part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of it I want you to hear for yourselves from him,
part I will tell you. It seems that James Nestor,
which is his name, found quite a rich claim out in
Arizona. He staked it out and, with some of the
gold in his possession, came East to see if he could
find a former partner he wanted to share in his
good luck.</p>

<p>“He reached Cresville and there he was taken
sick. He went to the old hut, where you found
him, and there, while he was helpless, some one,
whom you boys know to be Jack Pender, came
along and robbed him.</p>

<p>“Nestor made his way to New York, after his
mysterious disappearance from the hut, and he
found poor but faithful friends in the tenement
house.”</p>

<p>“What part of the story do you want him to tell
us himself?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“About his claim&mdash;his gold mine,” said Mr.
Wakefield. “I would rather you get that from
him direct.”</p>

<p>“Is he very sick?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“The doctor thinks he will be around in a few
days.”</p>

<p>“And what do you propose?” asked Bob, who
could see that Mr. Wakefield had something on
his mind.</p>

<p>“I think if you boys are going to make a western
trip you cannot do better than take this miner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
along with you,” answered the gentleman. “I
talked to him about it, after the doctor had given
him some quieting medicine, and he said he would
be glad of a chance to get out West.”</p>

<p>“Shall we wait here until he gets well?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“My plan would be for you boys to make up his
fare to Chicago,” said Mr. Wakefield, “and let
him join you there, say in a week. You can go by
auto and he can go by train.”</p>

<p>This plan met with the approval of the three
chums. They made up a purse for Jim Nestor and
arranged for Mr. Wakefield to take it to the miner.
The latter did so, and planned for the miner to
come on to Chicago when he was well and strong.</p>

<p>“The boys will put up at the Grand Hotel,” said
Mr. Wakefield, passing over the money, which was
to be Nestor’s fare to Chicago.</p>

<p>“And I’ll meet ’em there an’ put ’em up against
the greatest proposition they ever heard of,” promised
the miner.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />
<small>IN THE WINDY CITY.</small></h2>


<p>Five days later the automobile travelers
were in Chicago. No serious accidents had occurred
on the road, and they finished the first part
of their trip in good shape. All the boys thought
of was whether they would be allowed to proceed
farther West.</p>

<p>Andy Rush was obliged to leave them, for he
had promised to visit a relative of his mother. He
did not relish being separated from his chums.</p>

<p>“Tough!” he exclaimed. “Wish I could go
along&mdash;bully fun&mdash;shoot Indians&mdash;lasso the cowboys&mdash;kill
the buffalos&mdash;ride a wild bull&mdash;break
a bucking mustang&mdash;chase over the prairies&mdash;lots
of sport&mdash;whoop!”</p>

<p>“We’d like to have you come,” said Jerry, “but
your folks said you could go no farther, and we
have agreed to leave you here and take Mr. Nestor.
So we have to keep our word.”</p>

<p>Andy agreed that this was right, but the galvanic
youth certainly did hate to part from his friends.
The three chums put up at the Grand Hotel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Mr. Wakefield, after some parting words of advice,
left them, as he had some business to transact.
He said he did not expect to see them again before
he returned to Cresville, and wished them all sorts
of good luck.</p>

<p>“What’s the first thing to do?” asked Bob, when
the boys found themselves alone in their hotel
rooms.</p>

<p>“Wire home that we are safe and ask if we can
go farther West,” suggested Jerry. “But don’t
say anything about the miner. He may not show
up, and they’ll laugh at us if they find that we have
been fooled.”</p>

<p>The wires were soon busy with messages from
each of the three boys.</p>

<p>A day of anxious waiting ensued. Then, on the
second afternoon the bellboy brought three yellow
envelopes to their rooms. With trembling fingers
the boys tore the missives open.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! I can go!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“So can I!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Me, too!” put in Bob.</p>

<p>The boys executed an impromptu war-dance in
their delight.</p>

<p>“Ho for the West and the gold mines!” cried
Ned, trying to hug Jerry and Chunky at the
same time and finding it was too much of a contract.</p>

<p>There came a knock on the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess that’s some one to tell us to stop our
noise,” remarked Jerry. “I thought you chaps were
cutting up too rough.”</p>

<p>“As if he didn’t make as much of the row as any
of us!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>Bob opened the door. A well-dressed man, with
iron-gray moustache and hair, entered.</p>

<p>“Here I be!” he announced, “an’ I see you boys
are right on deck!”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve made a mistake,” said Jerry,
gently.</p>

<p>“Ain’t this the Grand Hotel, where I was to
meet the boys that befriended old Jim Nestor?”
the man asked.</p>

<p>Then the boys saw it was their friend, the miner.
But he had so changed in appearance, with a new
suit of clothes, and with his hair and whiskers
trimmed, that they did not recognize him. They
greeted him heartily.</p>

<p>“I got well quicker than I expected,”
went on Nestor, “an’ I couldn’t stand New
York any longer. Mr. Wakefield left me a
tidy sum. He grub-staked me, so to speak,
an’ I come West. Got a quick train an’ made
Chicago ’most as soon as you boys did in your auto
wagon.”</p>

<p>“We’re glad to see you,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No more than I am to see you,” put in the
miner. “Now let’s git right down to business.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
That’s my way. No beatin’ around the bush for
Jim Nestor.</p>

<p>“I told your friend, Mr. Wakefield, that I’d put
you boys up against a good big proposition. Now
I’m goin’ to do it. Can you go as far as Arizona
in that wagon of yours?”</p>

<p>“Farther if need be,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“Good! Now will your folks let you go?”</p>

<p>For answer the boys held out their telegrams.</p>

<p>“Good, again I see it’s all right. Now I want
you boys to know I ain’t so poor as I looked to be
when you found me. I’m rich, that’s what I am,
only I can’t git at my money.</p>

<p>“The long and short of it is that I discovered
down in the southern part of Arizona a rich gold
mine. It assays high. In fact, if you saw the
gold I had in the hut, you saw some of the
yellow stuff that came from my mine. It’s a lost
mine.”</p>

<p>“A lost mine?” exclaimed Bob, blankly. “Then
what good is it?”</p>

<p>“It was lost, but I found it again,” explained
Nestor. “There’s millions in it. It’s up in the
mountains, about a hundred miles from Tucson.
The gold is there, but it’s hard to reach.</p>

<p>“Now what I want to know is, can you boys go
there, or near there, in your choo-choo cart? If
you can, and we are successful, there’s a chance for
us all to make our fortunes, for I’ll give you boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
a share apiece for what you did for me when I was
in trouble.”</p>

<p>“I guess we can go,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’ll be a hard trip, full of trouble an’ some
danger,” warned the miner.</p>

<p>“We’ll risk it,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“When can you start?” asked Nestor.</p>

<p>“Let’s go right now!” exclaimed Bob, with such
earnestness that the other laughed.</p>

<p>“To-morrow or next day will do,” said Nestor.
“I have a few things to attend to. I’ll meet you
here, say day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>At the agreed time Nestor was on hand. In the
meantime the auto had been thoroughly overhauled,
put in shape for a long, hard trip, and extra
supplies purchased. It was a bright, sunny day
when the start from Chicago was made.</p>

<p>“Let her go!” exclaimed Nestor, as he climbed
into the rear seat with Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry, who was steering, threw in the gear
clutches and the machine moved off on its long
and what was destined to be eventful trip.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Nestor, suddenly.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry, stopping the
car.</p>

<p>“Have you boys got guns?”</p>

<p>“Guns?” repeated Jerry, somewhat in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Well, revolvers, then,” went on the miner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>In answer, Ned rather sheepishly took from his
valise three new double-action revolvers of excellent
make.</p>

<p>“I thought we might need ’em,” he said, “but I
was afraid you’d laugh at me and say it was
foolish.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right!” exclaimed Nestor. “I was
going to tell you to git some. You see, you don’t
always need a gun in Arizona, but when you do,
as the man in the story said about Texas, you need
it mighty bad an’ mighty sudden. So it’s a prime
thing you have ’em. I’ve got mine,” and he showed
two big .45 calibre ones.</p>

<p>Well armed, as well as otherwise provided for,
the little expedition started off again, the automobile
wending in and out through the busy Chicago
streets.</p>

<p>“We’ll make as straight a course as we can for
Tucson,” said Nestor. “I know the roads pretty
well, ’cause I traveled ’em in a stage years ago,
when Chicago was only a village.”</p>

<p>The machine was puffing along at a fair rate of
speed and had almost reached the outskirts of the
city when a policeman, mounted on a motor-cycle,
dashed up.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to take you in,” he announced.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Riding too fast in the city limits.”</p>

<p>“But we were going slow,” objected Jerry. “If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
you know anything about automobiles you can see
the lever is only on the first-speed notch, and that
only goes ten miles an hour at best.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it,” replied the officer. “I timed
you and you went too fast.”</p>

<p>“Dog-gone his hide, let me git my gun out an’
I’ll show him who he’s a-holdin’ up!” exclaimed
Nestor, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“No, no!” expostulated Ned, who overheard
the miner’s threat. “This isn’t out West. Don’t
pull any guns!”</p>

<p>“Well,” put in Jerry, speaking to the officer,
“if you think we were violating the law I suppose
we’ll have to go back with you. Shall I turn
around and accompany you?” he asked, politely.</p>

<p>“That’s what you better do. I don’t want no
fuss, but if you want trouble I’ll make it for you.”</p>

<p>The other boys wondered at Jerry’s easy compliance
with what they knew was an unreasonable
and unjust command. The steersman started
the machine slowly ahead, and, as the road
was wide, began to turn in a circle, to head back
to Chicago.</p>

<p>But when the auto was half way around, and
pointed in the direction of the Windy City, Jerry
did not continue on the way the officer expected.
Instead, the boy widened his circle, made a complete
revolution and then, throwing in the second
speed, dashed away down the road, leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
discomfited motor-policeman to rage over the trick
that had been played on him.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t going to submit to arrest when I knew
we were not guilty,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>In a little while Chicago was left behind, and
the auto dashed along a pleasant country road and
was making good time toward the West.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a puffing from behind that
told of another machine coming. It passed the
boys, who had slowed down a bit, and as it went
by the occupants of the Cresville machine had a
good view of those in the other car.</p>

<p>“Did you see them?” cried Jerry, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Bob, who had not given much
heed to the other auto.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon was in that machine, and with
him were Jack Pender and Bill Berry!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />
<small>A SHOT IN THE DARK.</small></h2>


<p>As Jerry spoke, the other boys looked and saw
Noddy turn to stare at them. The bully rose in his
seat and shook his fist at the Motor Boys, while the
wind bore back some indistinguishable words he
shouted.</p>

<p>“Let’s take after him!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“What would be the use?” asked Jerry. “We
don’t want trouble if we can avoid it. The farther
off those fellows are the better we’ll be.”</p>

<p>The boys explained to Nestor something about
the character of Noddy, Berry, and Pender, the
miner listening, gravely.</p>

<p>“Well, on the whole,” he remarked, “it’s better
to have an enemy in front of you than at your
back. I guess we can make out to beat ’em at whatever
game they play. But I’d like to catch the
chap as took my gold.”</p>

<p>Jerry started his machine up again, but made no
effort to catch up with Noddy, who was now far in
advance. The Cresville auto bowled along, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
at noon a stop was made in a small village, where
dinner was eaten.</p>

<p>They traveled along all the afternoon. Toward
dusk they struck a lonely stretch of country, and
inquiry at a log cabin brought out that the nearest
town was ten miles ahead.</p>

<p>“We must push for it,” said Nestor; “that is, if
we intend to sleep in beds to-night.”</p>

<p>Ned was steering, the boys having agreed to
take turn and turn about. It became quite dark, and
the auto was shooting along at reduced speed,
for, even with the gas and oil lamps, the road
was dim.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shot rang out in the darkness. It
was followed by a louder report as one of the auto
tires burst, punctured by a bullet. The car careened
to one side and bumped along on the flattened
rubber.</p>

<p>“They’re shooting at us!” cried Nestor. “Two
can play at that game!”</p>

<p>He whipped out his revolver and fired three
shots straight ahead, the flashes cutting the darkness.</p>

<p>“They’re behind, not ahead!” yelled Jerry, who
was in the rear seat with the miner. “It was one
of the back tires that burst!”</p>

<p>Ned had shut off power and the auto came to a
halt. The boys got out, and Jerry took off one of
the oil lamps to see what damage had been done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
A new inner tube would be needed, and it would
be hard work inserting it in the dark.</p>

<p>“That’s some of Noddy’s or Pender’s work,”
observed Ned. “They must be following us, and
yet they started off ahead.”</p>

<p>“There are so many roads around here that they
could go off to one side, wait, and then come up
behind us,” said Nestor. “But what’s to be done?”</p>

<p>“We can’t go ahead until we fix the tire,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to do it in the dark,” advised the
miner. “Tell you what to do. I’ll camp here with
the machine, for I’m used to sleeping outdoors
nights. It’s only about two miles into town now,
and you boys can walk it. In the morning you can
come back and fix things up.”</p>

<p>“What will you do for supper?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about that,” replied the
miner. “I’ve got a couple of sandwiches in my
pocket. I got ’em at the place we had dinner,
’cause I always like to travel with a little grub
about me. They’ll do until morning.”</p>

<p>So it was arranged. The lights on the auto were
put out and Nestor curled up in the tonneau, with
some lap-robes over him. The boys started afoot
for the town, promising to come back as soon as it
was light enough to see to put the new tube in the
tire.</p>

<p>“I wonder what Noddy’s game is?” asked Ned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of his companions. “And how did he and Pender
come together?”</p>

<p>“There’s no telling what those two may do,”
said Jerry. “I’m afraid we’re in for trouble.”</p>

<p>They were to meet it sooner than they expected.
About this time, a mile from where the crippled
auto was stalled, two figures were sneaking along
the road.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you hit the tire, Bill?” asked a
voice, which, if the Motor Boys had heard,
they would have recognized at once as Noddy
Nixon’s.</p>

<p>“Course I winged ’em,” replied Bill Berry. “It
was easy. All I had to do was to jump out from
behind the bushes where we were hid and pop at
’em. I could hear the tire bust.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if it made ’em lay up for repairs?”</p>

<p>“It sure did. I heard ’em shut off the power.
Now we’ll hustle back to our car and continue the
trip.”</p>

<p>“I’ll teach those Cresville cubs to come meddling
after me,” spoke Noddy. “I’ll follow ’em close
and make all the trouble I can. As you say, we
may as well start off again. I hope Pender isn’t
tired waiting alone for us in the car. How far
ahead is it now?”</p>

<p>“Half a mile, I guess.”</p>

<p>As the Motor Boys knew, Noddy had made for
New York after running away from home with Bill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Berry. He wrote to the boys and to Pender from
there, and later Pender joined the rascally pair.</p>

<p>Noddy was preparing for a trip with his companions,
and was just about to start when Jerry
spied him from the hotel window. He escaped
through the tenement house and at once got ready
to leave New York in a hurry.</p>

<p>It was by the merest chance that he passed the
Cresville auto on leaving Chicago, and at once had
formed the plan of annoying the three chums.</p>

<p>As Nestor had said, Noddy and his companions
had taken a side road, allowed the Cresville auto
to get ahead and then, at Berry’s suggestion, had
ambushed themselves to try and do some damage
as the Motor Boys passed. The chief conspirators
were now on their way to where they had left their
auto.</p>

<p>They reached it, found Pender half asleep,
curled up on a seat, and started slowly off in the
darkness.</p>

<p>By keeping to the diverging road they were on,
they passed around the disabled machine, and came
out into the main highway again, ahead of the
three boys who were tramping toward the town.</p>

<p>Noddy was steering, and with a reckless disregard
of the dangers of the road was going very
fast. Suddenly there was a crash and the auto
stopped.</p>

<p>“You’ve gone an’ done it now!” exclaimed Bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“What if I have?” snapped Noddy. “It’s my
machine, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“An’ it’s my neck you’re tryin’ to break,” replied
Bill. “What’s the trouble, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Noddy got out to look. Something had gone
wrong with the sliding gear and he had to crawl
under the machine to fix it, while Pender held a
light. Bill obstinately refused to lend a hand, as
he said it was all Noddy’s fault.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to walk on to the next town,” declared
Berry. “You can stop an’ pick me up on
your way through. I’ll be at the hotel.”</p>

<p>He went off in the darkness, while Noddy and
Jack continued to work at the auto. It took more
than half an hour to fix the break, but at last the
machine was ready to start. Noddy was about to
crank it up when he heard the sound of some persons
coming along the road, voices mingling with
the footsteps.</p>

<p>He looked up, and was much surprised to
see, in the glare of the lamps, Jerry, Bob and
Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Noddy, faintly, for he did not know
what else to say.</p>

<p>On their part the Motor Boys were as much
startled as was Noddy at the unexpected meeting.</p>

<p>“So you’re here, are you?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see without having to be told?” inquired
Noddy, with a surly growl. “Now you’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
seen us, you’d better go on and mind your own
business.”</p>

<p>“I guess this is a free country, and we have as
much right on this road as you have,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“You haven’t any right to follow me all the
while!” burst out the former bully of Cresville.</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t be following you if you hadn’t
fired at us and punctured the tire!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Who says I fired a shot?” demanded Noddy.</p>

<p>“I do!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you’re talking about!”
exclaimed the bully. “If you say another word
I’ll lick you!”</p>

<p>He was mad clear through, and made a rush at
Ned. Jerry sprang forward and met Noddy with
a blow straight from the shoulder. The bully went
down. He got up quickly, and the two boys went
at each other, “hammer and tongs.” Jerry kept
his head and landed twice, heavily, on Noddy. The
latter gave Jerry a bad blow on the right eye, but
the latter retaliated by making Noddy’s nose bleed.</p>

<p>As Noddy felt the warm blood trickling down
his face he became frightened.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” he cried. “Why don’t you help
me, Jack?”</p>

<p>Pender had discreetly remained in the car. At
this he jumped out. Ned was ready, however, and
stepped in front of him. Jack aimed a blow at
Ned. The latter dodged it and sent a straight left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
for Pender’s head. It caught him on the jaw and
he went down heavily.</p>

<p>By this time Noddy had broken away from Jerry
and ran toward the auto. Jerry was satisfied with
the punishment he had inflicted and did not follow.
Noddy quickly cranked up his machine and
leaped to the steering seat.</p>

<p>“Come on, Jack!” he cried.</p>

<p>Pender wiggled from the grip in which Ned held
him, jumped into the car beside the bully and the
next instant the two enemies of the Motor Boys
were chugging off down the road.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />
<small>ENCIRCLED BY COWBOYS.</small></h2>


<p>For a few moments the three chums stood staring
at the vanishing auto. Then Jerry, with a
grunt, felt of his damaged eye.</p>

<p>“I guess I don’t owe Noddy anything,” he remarked,
drily.</p>

<p>“I paid off some old scores to Pender,” said
Ned, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Wish I’d got a chance at one of them!” observed
Bob.</p>

<p>“You’re just as well off, Chunky,” spoke Jerry.
“We may as well keep on to town, now the excitement
is over. It’s getting late, and I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>In about half an hour they were in the village,
where they found a good hotel. They caught no
sight of Noddy and his companions.</p>

<p>The next morning the boys made a hasty breakfast
and hired a man to drive them out to their
stranded auto. They found Nestor just awakening
from what he declared had been a refreshing sleep.
The punctured tire was soon repaired, and, dismissing
the driver of the wagon, the boys and the miner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
sped to town in the machine. They put up at the
hotel, where Nestor made a good breakfast.</p>

<p>As a few supplies were needed for the auto, it
was decided to lay over for a day in the town.
Jerry attended to the purchases, while Nestor and
the other boys took things easy in the room they
had hired at the hotel.</p>

<p>“I’m sure glad I met you, boys,” said the old
miner, stretching out in a comfortable chair. “I’m
jest countin’ the days ’till we git out to the gold
mine.”</p>

<p>“Will it take long now?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We ought to reach Tucson in about two weeks
now. Of course it’s going to be a little hard gittin’
over the New Mexico mountain range, but I guess
the choo-choo wagon will do it. We may have a
little trouble findin’ the mine, too.”</p>

<p>“I thought you said you had it all staked out,”
observed Chunky.</p>

<p>“So I have,” answered Nestor. “But you see it’s
in a part of the mountains not very well traveled.
I’ve lost my way more than once there. But I
reckon I can find the mine. Once I strike the trail
leadin’ out of Dead Horse Gulch I’m all right.
The mine isn’t far from there.”</p>

<p>If the miner could have looked into the next
room he would not have talked so freely concerning
the mine. For, in the adjoining apartment was
Bill Berry. He listened intently to what Nestor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
said, and soon was able to tell, from the conversation,
who the occupants in the room next to him
were.</p>

<p>“A gold mine, eh?” said Bill, softly. “I reckon
Noddy and I will get in on that deal. We must
profit by this. I wish Noddy would hurry up. We
must follow those young cubs.”</p>

<p>Bill, in a measure, was stranded at the hotel.
He had reached it after leaving Noddy the night
previous, and expected his companion to follow,
after repairing the auto, and pick him up. But the
encounter between Noddy and the Motor Boys
made the former change his plans, and he ran the
machine through the village without stopping for
Berry. Later, however, Noddy came back and
got his companion.</p>

<p>For some time Nestor and the boys conversed
about the gold mine, the man telling the lads many
stories of western life. Jerry had completed his
purchases by dusk, the auto tanks were refilled with
gasolene and water, and the start was made early
the next morning.</p>

<p>A few hours of travel brought the adventurers
to the Mississippi River, and crossing it, they found
themselves in Missouri. For several days the auto
journeyed on, and Kansas was more than half traversed.</p>

<p>One hot afternoon, passing over a road that
led across the rolling prairie, Bob, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
steering, looked ahead and noticed quite a cloud
of dust.</p>

<p>“Looks like a whirlwind coming,” he remarked.</p>

<p>Nestor stood up and peered forward.</p>

<p>“So it is, but not the kind you’re used to,” he
said.</p>

<p>“What kind is it?”</p>

<p>“Cowboys, an’ they’re headed right for us. I
expect there’ll be some fun presently,” and the
miner began loading his big revolver.</p>

<p>“Will they&mdash;will they kill us?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, no; not exactly kill you,” spoke the
miner, slowly, “but they’ll try to scare you to death,
and that’s about as bad.”</p>

<p>The wind now bore to the ears of the boys a
thundering sound. It was the rapid hoof-beats of
the cowboys’ ponies as they raced along. As yet
nothing of the riders could be seen because of the
dust.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came from the center of the
cloud a series of terrific yells, punctuated by a score
of revolver shots. At the same time forty cowboys
were disclosed to the astonished gaze of the
Cresville lads. Bob stopped the machine, for it was
fairly surrounded by a circle of the rough riders.</p>

<p>“Throw up your hands!” yelled one who seemed
to be the leader of the herders. He was astride a
black pony, and as he spoke he leveled two big
revolvers at the party in the auto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Tremblingly, the boys obeyed.</p>

<p>“I mean you, too, you old greaser on the back
of this new-fangled stage coach!” exclaimed the
leader, waving his gun at Nestor. “Put up your
hands, an’ do it mighty suddint!”</p>

<p>Nestor’s reply was a shot from his revolver, and
the hat of the leader went spinning in the air.</p>

<p>“Here!” cried the cowboy, angrily, but not returning
the fire, “don’t you know better than to
shoot a gentleman’s hat off?”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen?” inquired Nestor, standing up and
surveying the bunch of cattlemen, with a smile. “I
don’t see any.”</p>

<p>There was a laugh among the herdsmen at the
discomfiture of their leader, and seeing the joke
was against him, the man on the black pony joined
in the merriment.</p>

<p>“We didn’t intend no harm nohow,” he said.
“We’re jest out for a lark, an’ we seen your Old
Nick wagon comin’ along. No offense I hope.
We was only jokin’!”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” said Nestor, who seemed
to know how to take the cowboys. “I suppose my
friends may now lower their hands,” for Jerry,
Ned and Bob still held their arms aloft.</p>

<p>“Sure!” cried the leader, quickly. “Come on,
boys, three cheers for the tenderfeet!” he exclaimed,
turning to his companions.</p>

<p>The cheers were given with a will, some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
more exuberant of the cow-punchers firing their
guns in the air.</p>

<p>“Some of us boys would like mighty well to take
a little spin in that shebang,” spoke the leader to
Nestor. “S’pose we could take a few turns?”</p>

<p>“I reckon so,” answered the miner, and he spoke
a few quick words to Jerry, advising that the wish
of the cowboys be complied with, as they might,
in their recklessness, make trouble if they were
denied.</p>

<p>Jerry took Bob’s place at the wheel, the others
got out and the leader of the cowboys and two of
his companions got into the auto. They were delighted
with the way Jerry spun the machine along.
By turns nearly all of the cattle rustlers were given
a short journey in the car.</p>

<p>Then three, who seemed full of the spirit of mischief,
took their seats. No sooner had Jerry
started off with them than the cowboy in the seat
with him tried to grab the steering wheel.</p>

<p>“Hold on there!” exclaimed the boy.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, sonny,” said the cowboy. “I
reckon I can run this as well as you. Let me have
a turn at it. I’ll show you what’s what!”</p>

<p>Jerry was firm in his refusal to let the man run
the machine. He knew the cattle-puncher would
speedily come to grief. Nestor observed the little
difficulty and appealed to the leader to use his persuasion
on the refractory fellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>But the latter’s two companions now joined in
his demand, and Jerry was being roughly handled
as the men sought to put him from his seat. Suddenly
the boy brought the car to a stop. He had a
plan in mind.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see an automobile turn a somersault?”
he asked the man who had first wanted
to steer.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t, sonny,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Would you like to see it?”</p>

<p>“Bet your boots.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do it with you in, it takes experts to
work that trick,” went on Jerry. “If you will
kindly get out and allow my friends to get back
in, I think I can surprise you.”</p>

<p>“Whoop!” yelled the cowboys in the auto, as
they descended. “Whoop! Now for some fun!”</p>

<p>Jerry drove the car to where Nestor, Bob and
Ned were standing. He motioned them to get in,
and they obeyed, wondering what he was going to
do. The cowboys, gathered in a wide circle about
the machine, looked on in anticipation of seeing
the auto do a flip-flop.</p>

<p>“Hold fast!” cautioned Jerry to his companions
in the car. They did so. The next instant
the boy put on full power and dashed straight at
the encircling ring of cattlemen.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />
<small>CAPTURING A HORSE THIEF.</small></h2>


<p>“Whoop! Watch it turn over!” yelled some of
the cowboys.</p>

<p>But Jerry kept straight on. Nearer and nearer
he came to the ring. At length, ten feet away,
when he feared he would have to put on the emergency
brake to avoid a collision, the nervous mustangs
in front of the car broke into a frightened run
and dashed over the prairie, while Jerry guided
the car away from the herdsmen, who were soon
left far behind.</p>

<p>“I told them I’d give ’em a surprise, and I did,”
said Jerry. “I didn’t promise to make the auto
turn a flip-flop, I only asked them if they ever saw
it done. Well, I never did, either. I guess things
are about evened up.”</p>

<p>The astonished cries of the cattlemen left no
doubt but that Jerry’s trick to escape from them
had been very much of a surprise.</p>

<p>“They didn’t intend any harm,” said Nestor.
“I know the character of cowboys. They’re full
of fun an’ thoughtless. It’s jest as well we got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
away, though. No tellin’ what damage they’d
have done to the machine.”</p>

<p>The auto rolled along for several miles and the
occupants were beginning to think of supper, which
they planned to eat in a small town about three
miles further on.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Ned, pointing off to the
left of the road. The others looked, and saw strolling
over the prairie a peculiar figure.</p>

<p>It was that of a little man, wearing a big,
flapping brimmed hat. The old fellow held a big
butterfly net in his right hand, and a large, green
box in the other. On his back was slung a bag.
Every now and then the stranger would raise the
net high in the air and bring it down with a swoop.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Looks to me like he was looney,” suggested
Nestor.</p>

<p>Jerry brought the machine to a stop. The queer
little man came nearer. His eyes were staring in
front of him at something he seemed to desire to
capture in the net. Whatever it was it continually
escaped him.</p>

<p>At length the odd figure was close to the automobile.
Yet the little man did not notice the car. Suddenly
his eyes glanced at one of the big front tires.
The boys looked and saw perched on the rubber a
small, brown butterfly.</p>

<p>“Softly&mdash;softly!” exclaimed the little man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
speaking to himself. “Easy now. I have you, my
beauty. Long have you escaped me, but I am
on your trail. Ah! Don’t move now. Softly!
There!”</p>

<p>He banged the net down on the tire, sprang
forward and caught the meshes between his fingers.
Through his bespectacled eyes he peered
eagerly at what he thought he had captured. A
disappointed look came on his face.</p>

<p>“Got away again!” he muttered. Then he
looked up and saw the party in the auto watching
him. He did not seem in the least surprised. At
once his eyes fastened on Jerry.</p>

<p>“Don’t move! Don’t move! I beg of you!”
he cried to the boy. “Don’t stir as you value your
life. I’ll lose one thousand dollars if you move
the hundredth part of an inch! Easy now. Ah!
There you are, my little brown beauty. Don’t
move, my boy, and I’ll catch it in a second!”</p>

<p>Somewhat puzzled at the little man’s words,
Jerry sat still. His companions saw on his back
the little brown butterfly that had escaped from the
tire.</p>

<p>Quickly the little man brought his net down on
Jerry’s shoulders. Once more the meshes were
eagerly grasped, and this time it seemed with success,
for the little man set up a yell of delight and
capered about like a boy who has found a hornets’
nest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve got it! I’ve got it!” he cried. “One of
the rarest butterflies that exist. I’ve been chasing
after this one all day. I knew I’d get it. But
pardon me, gentlemen. No doubt you are surprised.
Allow me to introduce myself. Professor
Uriah Snodgrass, A. M., Ph.D., M. D., F. R.
G. S., etc.”</p>

<p>“Is that all, pardner?” asked Nestor, with a
grin.</p>

<p>“I contemplate taking the degree of B. A. this
winter, when I have completed my study of the
fauna and flora of the prairies,” replied the little
man.</p>

<p>Jerry introduced himself and his companions,
and said they were making a tour across country.</p>

<p>“Just what I am doing myself,” said Professor
Snodgrass. “I am collecting specimens of rare
plants, stones, bugs, butterflies, in fact, anything
that can add to knowledge and science. I have
been out all day&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped talking and made a sudden grab at
the sleeve of Nestor’s coat.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” exclaimed the miner.
“Rattlesnake?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me!” replied the professor. “There
was a very scarce specimen of what is commonly
called the potato bug on you, and I wanted it.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather you’d have it than me,” observed
Nestor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Professor Snodgrass, as
he placed the bug, together with the butterfly, in
his green box. “What was I saying?”</p>

<p>“That you had been out all day,” repeated
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I left town early this morning, and
my labors have been richly repaid. See, I have my
box and bag nearly full.”</p>

<p>He showed the box. Through the glass top the
boys could see that it was full of toads, grasshoppers,
small snakes, lizards, bugs, butterflies and
bees. The bag was loaded with stones, grass,
pieces of wood, plants and flowers.</p>

<p>“It has been a grand day,” went on the professor,
enthusiastically, “and I haven’t had a bit of
dinner.”</p>

<p>“None of that for mine,” put in Nestor. “I
wouldn’t go without my meals for all the bugs and
stones in the world.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you are not a naturalist,” observed the
professor, wiping his bald head.</p>

<p>“Did you walk all the way?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No; I had a horse. And, bless my soul, I’ve
forgotten what I did with the beast. I got off him
early this morning to chase after that brown butterfly
and I left the horse standing somewhere on
the prairie.”</p>

<p>“He evidently was too fond of your company to
leave you, however,” said Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why so, young man?” and the professor gazed
up through his spectacles.</p>

<p>“Because that is evidently him coming along
back there,” and Jerry pointed to a horse slowly
approaching.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes! There he is. I’m glad I didn’t lose
him, for I suppose the man from whom I hired
him would have been angry.”</p>

<p>“I guess yes,” spoke Nestor, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“If you are going into town we’ll ride along
with you,” said Ned. “That is, if your horse isn’t
afraid of automobiles.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he is afraid of anything,” replied
the professor. “I captured a fine specimen of grasshopper
on his left ear this morning, and he never
shied when I put the net over his head.”</p>

<p>The little man, seeing that his bag and box were
safely strapped to his back, and folding up his net,
mounted the horse that had approached where he
was standing and started off alongside of the auto,
which Jerry ran slowly.</p>

<p>The boys learned that the professor was stopping
in the same town where they planned to spend
the night.</p>

<p>“We’ll be there very soon now,” observed the
little man, “and I’ll be glad of it, for I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, from behind, there came a wild chorus
of yells and shouts, revolver shots mingling with
the noise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s the cowboys coming back!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Nonsense; they are miles behind us,” observed
Nestor.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re some kind of cowboys, anyhow,”
cried Jerry. “And they’re after us.”</p>

<p>Bang! bang! went the guns. “Whoop!” yelled
the cattlemen who were riding like mad. “Stop
the horse thief!” they shouted.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the cattlemen, a bunch
similar to those who had wanted to run the auto.</p>

<p>“They seem to be after us,” observed Bob.</p>

<p>“We haven’t stolen any horses,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“What’s all the noise about?” asked Professor
Snodgrass, suddenly becoming aware that there
was some commotion. He was riding close to the
auto.</p>

<p>There came a hissing, whistling sound in the air.
A long, thin line shot forward. A loop settled
around the professor’s neck. The next instant he
was jerked, none too gently, from the back of his
horse and fell to the ground. He had been lassoed
from behind by one of the cowboys.</p>

<p>Jerry shut off the power and the auto stopped.
In a few seconds it was surrounded by a crowd of
angry men. Several of them drew their revolvers,
while two or three busied themselves in securely
binding the poor professor.</p>

<p>“What’s all this for?” asked Nestor, getting
ready to draw his gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know as it’s any of your business, unless
you’re in on the game,” spoke a dark-complexioned
cowboy, who seemed to be the leader.</p>

<p>“What game?” asked the miner.</p>

<p>“Stealing horses,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Who’s stolen any nags around here?” demanded
Nestor.</p>

<p>“That bald-headed galoot!” exclaimed the cowboy.
“We want him for taking that pony he was
riding. It belongs to One-Eyed Pete.”</p>

<p>“He never stole that!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“He didn’t, eh? Well, he can tell that to Judge
Lynch. There’s only one thing happens to horse
thieves in this country.”</p>

<p>“Swing him up!” yelled the cowboys, yanking
Professor Snodgrass to his feet.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />
<small>THE AUTO ON FIRE.</small></h2>


<p>“Can’t we save him?” cried Jerry to Nestor.
“He never took that horse. It’s all a mistake.”</p>

<p>“It’s no use to reason with those brutes,” said
the miner. “They evidently believe they’re right.
It’s too bad, but we’d only git into trouble if we
interfered.”</p>

<p>“Bring him along, boys!” cried the leader.
“There’s a tree that will do to swing him from, and
I’ve got the rope!”</p>

<p>The boys were almost horror-stricken at the
scene they were about to witness. It was bad
enough to see any one hanged, but to witness the
death of the little bug-hunting man they all believed
innocent was too much.</p>

<p>The cowboys, with the poor professor in their
midst, rode across the prairie to where a single tree
grew. They had quieted down, now that their
man-hunt was over. Jerry started the auto and
steered it across the rolling land toward the scene
of the prospective lynching.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Nestor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t desert him,” replied Jerry. “Maybe we
can get the cowboys to let him go.”</p>

<p>Nestor shook his head pityingly. He knew the
rough western men too well. They never let even
a suspected horse thief escape.</p>

<p>Little time was lost in preparation. Once beneath
the tree the men formed in a circle. The
rope was thrown over a limb and a noose made.
The professor was placed beneath it, and the other
end of the rope was grasped by a dozen hands.</p>

<p>“Have you anything to say before we string you
up?” asked the leader.</p>

<p>Aside from a little paleness, which hardly
showed in the waning afternoon, Professor Snodgrass
gave no sign of what must be a terrible ordeal
for him. He did not seem to appreciate what
was taking place.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he stood beneath the fatal noose,
he leaned forward. One hand sought the green
box which was still strapped to his back. The other
went out with a cautious gesture to the arm of the
leader of the cowboys.</p>

<p>“Don’t stir! Don’t move for the world!” exclaimed
the professor, in a strained whisper. “Just
a second and I’ll have him!”</p>

<p>His hand closed on something on the leader’s
coat-sleeve and he uttered a cry that was more of
delight than fear.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it! I’ve got it!” he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Got what?” asked the cowboy.</p>

<p>“One of the rarest specimens of a prairie lizard
that exists!” replied the professor, as, all unconscious
of the dangling noose, he thrust the specimen
into his green box. “This is certainly a lucky
day for me.”</p>

<p>“I’d say it was particularly unlucky,” observed
the leader, with a grim smile, adjusting the noose
about the neck of the naturalist.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s all the fuss about?” asked the
professor, noticing for the first time that he was
in a crowd. “Has anything happened?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” exclaimed Nestor, who
overheard the conversation. “The poor professor
is so absent-minded that he don’t know he’s been
lassoed and is all ready to be strung up!”</p>

<p>“Hold fast!” exclaimed Jerry, suddenly. “I’m
going to rescue him!”</p>

<p>“How?” asked Nestor.</p>

<p>“I’m going to run the auto in close to him.
When I do, you reach out and grab him up.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I’m on!” said Nestor.</p>

<p>Jerry gave a loud blast on the horn. The cowboys,
who did not know exactly what to do about
hanging a man who didn’t seem to mind being
lynched, turned to see what was going on, having
forgotten all about the auto. There was a living
lane between the men right up to where the bug
collector stood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry sent the machine ahead with a rush.
Straight at the professor he steered it. Then, when
very close to the bug hunter he gave the wheel a
twist.</p>

<p>Nestor, who was in the rear seat, on the side
nearest Mr. Snodgrass, leaned over. As he swept
past the professor the miner grabbed him up, box,
basket, net and all, and lifted him into the auto.</p>

<p>“Full speed ahead!” yelled Nestor, and Jerry
threw on all the power he had.</p>

<p>The little, bald-headed man was yanked from
under the tree, and, as the noose was about his
neck the rope came along with him, pulled from
the surprised and unresisting hands of the cowboys.</p>

<p>They gave a great shout of astonishment, and
several leaped on their horses to give pursuit.
Others drew their revolvers and fired at the fast-vanishing
auto, but the machine was soon out of
reach of the bullets.</p>

<p>“That’s what I call pullin’ off a pretty neat
trick,” observed Nestor. “They’d have hung you
in another minute, professor.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’m much obliged to you,” observed
the little man, calmly. “I hope my specimens are
not injured, for I have some very valuable ones.”</p>

<p>“Well, he is the limit!” said Nestor, half to himself.
“He gits pulled out of the very jaws of
death an’ all he cares about is his bugs an’ butterflies!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon they were nearly at the town where they
were to stop overnight. The professor, who
seemed a little dazed from what he had gone
through, was gazing at the rope that had been
taken from his neck and tossed to the floor of the
tonneau. All at once he stood up and shot a glance
at a horse that was grazing beside the road.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter&mdash;want to take another
nag?” asked Nestor.</p>

<p>“No; but that is the horse I hired. I recognize
him by the extra butterfly net I fastened to the
saddle. I was afraid I might lose one. The other
horse wasn’t mine.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t yours?” fairly shouted the miner.
“Then whose was it?”</p>

<p>“It must have belonged to the cowboys,” was
the answer. “You see, I forgot all about my horse
until I met you. Then I took the first animal I
saw. I supposed, of course, it was mine.”</p>

<p>“Then you really were a horse thief after all,”
said Ned, laughing, “though you didn’t know it.”</p>

<p>“And the cowboys were right, as far as they
knew,” observed Jerry. “They saw you on one
of their horses and naturally thought you stole it.
However, it all came out right, and I guess I did
the best thing when I rescued you, for they might
have hanged you before the mistake was found
out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The auto created no little surprise as it puffed
through the western town, though a sign, “Gasolene
for Sale,” exhibited in front of the drug store,
indicated that machines sometimes paid a visit.
The hotel where Professor Snodgrass was stopping
was soon reached, and every one washed up
and had supper.</p>

<p>The next morning, after a few minor repairs had
been made to the auto, and the gasolene tank replenished,
the travelers prepared to start away
again. The professor was up to see them off.</p>

<p>“I wish I was going with you,” he said, with a
pleasant smile, after they had told him something
of the trip they had in view.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you?” inquired Jerry. “We are
going into somewhat new territory, and you may
be able to collect some fine specimens. We can
easily make room for you.”</p>

<p>“I might go along with you on a horse,” ventured
the little man.</p>

<p>“That’s too risky,” observed Nestor. “Take
the boys’ offer and come along without a horse.”</p>

<p>“I believe I will; I have nothing to keep me
here,” said the bug collector, and so it was arranged.</p>

<p>A good stock of provisions was laid in, the auto
being piled with all it could hold and still leave
room for the five passengers. Nestor said they
would probably have to camp out a few nights, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
on leaving Kansas and skirting down into New
Mexico, settlements were few and far between.
So some rubber and woolen blankets were added
to the outfit.</p>

<p>So far the weather had been fine, but this morning
there was a haze in the sky that denoted a
storm. It did not worry any one, however, and
made the professor smile.</p>

<p>“There’ll be so many more grasshoppers and
bugs for me after the shower,” he observed.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and the auto was bowling along
at a good pace on a level stretch of road. Soon
Nestor, who was sitting in front with Bob, who was
steering, jumped up.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” inquired Jerry. “One of
the professor’s grasshoppers bite you?”</p>

<p>“The seat seems to be gittin’ too hot for comfort,”
said the miner.</p>

<p>From beneath the auto there came a muffled explosion,
followed by a big cloud of smoke. Then
flames shot out, and the whole under side of the
car was enveloped.</p>

<p>“We’re on fire!” yelled Bob, preparing to jump.</p>

<p>“Sit still!” exclaimed Jerry. “Don’t let go the
wheel whatever you do!”</p>

<p>“Turn off the gasolene!” cried Ned. “The tank
is leaking and the gasolene is burning!”</p>

<p>There was great excitement. The only person
who kept his head was Professor Snodgrass. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
did not seem to know the auto was on fire, but was
calmly examining a small bug crawling on the cushion
near him.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” wailed Bob. “The auto
will be destroyed!”</p>

<p>“We’re in a bad fix!” muttered the miner.</p>

<p>Bob reached over to shut off the power, and was
making ready to jump.</p>

<p>“Sit still!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“And be killed?” objected Bob.</p>

<p>The smoke became more dense and the flames
spouted up higher around the car.</p>

<p>“Quick! There’s a small creek! Steer for it!”
yelled Jerry, pointing ahead.</p>

<p>Bob saw the water and realized Jerry’s plan.
He quickly turned the auto toward the water.
There was a sort of ford turning off from the main
road, which latter led over a small bridge.</p>

<p>Into the creek dashed the burning machine.
There was a hiss as the water reached the flames,
and clouds of steam arose.</p>

<p>Then, amid a swish of spray, the machine shot
out on the opposite bank, only the machinery, as
far up as the under side of the floor of the car, having
been submerged. The fire was put out as good
as if a whole city department had been called to
battle with the flames.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />
<small>AT DEAD MAN’S GULCH.</small></h2>


<p>Bob brought the auto to a stop under a big
sycamore tree. The engine was still smoking, and
there was considerable heat. Jerry jumped out and
examined the car.</p>

<p>“Not much damage done,” he said, after a long
inspection. “I guess we can fix it up.”</p>

<p>“Can we go on?” asked Ned, anxiously.</p>

<p>“It will take a good hour to mend things,” replied
Jerry.</p>

<p>“That will give me a chance to gather some
bugs,” observed the professor. “Pardon me,” he
exclaimed to Nestor. “There is a beautiful specimen
of a katydid on your leg,” and, with a deft
gesture, the bug collector captured the insect and
transferred it to his box.</p>

<p>“I hope you didn’t want it yourself,” said the
naturalist, looking rather anxiously at the miner,
who seemed surprised.</p>

<p>“Oh, land, no!” was the reply. “Help yourself
whenever you see any of the crawlin’ things on me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
It’s a favor, more than anything else. I hate bugs
an’ things.”</p>

<p>While the professor wandered about with his
net, Jerry proceeded to repair the leak to the gasolene
tank. Bob and Ned decided they were
hungry, and got out some lunch, of which, a little
later, all were glad to partake.</p>

<p>“There,” announced Jerry, “I guess we can go
on again.”</p>

<p>“There’s a good place to camp about twenty
miles farther on,” said Nestor.</p>

<p>“What place is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Dead Man’s Gulch,” was the grim reply.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t sound very pleasant,” observed Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s a better locality than it sounds, Chunky,”
went on Nestor. “There’s a little town there, if
you want to sleep in beds.”</p>

<p>The boys decided to push for the Gulch, not that
sleeping in beds was an inducement, for they rather
liked the idea of resting in the open. But the
gathering clouds indicated rain, and that would
make camping out rather damp.</p>

<p>Without further mishap the machine was sent
along. Ned was at the wheel and he turned on
plenty of gasolene so that the car fairly skimmed
over the roads. As they passed a stone post on the
highway, Nestor called out:</p>

<p>“Good-by, Kansas!”</p>

<p>“What’s that for?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because that’s the boundary mark between
Kansas and Indian Territory,” replied the miner.
“We are now on the old Indian ground, pretty soon
we’ll be in Texas, and then we’ll land in New
Mexico.”</p>

<p>“We’re getting to be travelers for fair!” remarked
Bob.</p>

<p>The gathering clouds became blacker and a
strong wind sprang up. There was every prospect
of a severe storm, and Ned sent the machine
ahead still faster. As it came to the top of a little
hill, Nestor exclaimed:</p>

<p>“There’s Dead Man’s Gulch!”</p>

<p>Looking down into the valley, the boys saw a
small settlement.</p>

<p>“Hold the machine back,” cautioned the miner.
“It may get away from you on the grade.”</p>

<p>Ned shut off the power and coasted down. In
half an hour they reached the level and started up
the road, which led into the main street, and, in
fact, the only thoroughfare in the town. Just as
they reached the solitary hotel in the settlement
the rain came down in torrents.</p>

<p>The auto was run under a shed and the occupants
entered the hostelry, to the no small surprise
of the inmates of the place, who had not heard the
car come up.</p>

<p>“Howdy, strangers?” called the clerk, a big
man, with an immense black moustache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Howdy?” responded Nestor, who seemed much
at his ease, though the boys were rather startled to
find themselves in what was evidently rough company.</p>

<p>“Where ye from?” asked the clerk.</p>

<p>“East,” replied Nestor.</p>

<p>“Where ye goin’?”</p>

<p>“West.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t much on the talk, be ye, stranger?”
sneered the clerk.</p>

<p>“I am when it suits me.”</p>

<p>“Aw! he’s one of them stuck-up automobilists!”
put in a tall, thin, dark-complexioned man, who was
sitting in one chair, with his feet in another.</p>

<p>“An’ who might you be?” asked Nestor, turning
to him.</p>

<p>“Pud Stoneham, at your service,” and the dark
man bowed with elaborate grace, a sneering smile
spreading over his face.</p>

<p>“Well, you’d better be mindin’ your own business!”
snapped Nestor, turning away.</p>

<p>“What’s that!” exclaimed Stoneham, who was
a gambler, hanging around the hotel on the lookout
for victims. “I don’t allow any man to insult
me!” and he reached his hand to his hip-pocket,
with a quick gesture.</p>

<p>Before he could draw his gun, which was his
intention, Nestor had him covered with a
weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“No shootin’, gentlemen!” called the clerk.
“Against the rules. Put up your gun, stranger.”</p>

<p>“Not unless he agrees to put up his,” stipulated
Nestor.</p>

<p>“I’ll make him,” said the clerk. And, with a
scowl, Stoneham promised to be peaceable. In a
little while he sneaked out.</p>

<p>Nestor and the boys registered and were assigned
to rooms for the night. The hotel was not a very
stylish one, but they were glad even for the rough
accommodations when they heard the torrent of
rain outside.</p>

<p>While they were washing up for supper, Ned
suddenly called out:</p>

<p>“Hark!”</p>

<p>“What is it? The place on fire?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard an automobile horn,” replied
Ned.</p>

<p>“Maybe some boys are monkeying with our machine,”
came from Bob.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t that, Chunky,” went on Ned, looking
from a window.</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“It’s another automobile coming up the road.
My, how the mud and water splashes! And, say!
Good land! Who do you suppose is in the car?”</p>

<p>“The President?” answered Jerry, sozzling his
face in the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s Noddy Nixon, Jack Pender and Bill
Berry!”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is!”</p>

<p>The others crowded to the windows to look.
Sure enough, there were the three enemies of the
Motor Boys. They ran their machine up under
the shed where stood the red auto, and then Ned
lost sight of them.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a free country,” observed Nestor.
“It looks as if they were following you, but there’s
no law to prevent it. I guess they won’t stay here
long, though, after that chap that robbed me
knows I’m stopping at this hotel. Wait until I get
my hands on him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be better not to let him know
who you are,” suggested Jerry. “They may be up
to some trick, and we can work to better advantage
against them by keeping quiet.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” admitted the miner, after
thinking the matter over. “He wouldn’t know me
if he saw me, since I got shaved. We’ll just lay
low an’ watch.”</p>

<p>The Motor Boys, with Nestor and Professor
Snodgrass, were the first ones down to the dining-room
to supper. In a little while Noddy, Jack and
Bill entered. The three latter started in surprise
at beholding the Cresville boys, and for a moment
seemed undecided what to do. Then, at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
whispered word from Berry, they filed to the
other side of the room and took their seats at
a table.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they really followed us,” Jerry
said.</p>

<p>“Must have,” was Nestor’s opinion. “But I
reckon they didn’t expect to find you here.”</p>

<p>“But what can their object be?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they exactly know themselves,”
replied the miner. “I guess they hope to annoy
you, or they may expect to get a line on what our
plans are. But we’ll try to fool ’em.”</p>

<p>Before the meal was over, Pud Stoneham came
in and took a seat at Noddy’s table. In a little
while the gambler seemed to be on good terms with
Bill Berry and his companions.</p>

<p>It was still raining hard when the three boys,
with the professor and Nestor, went up to bed.
The naturalist and the boys had two rooms, while
Nestor was by himself. Noddy and his chums
disappeared after the meal, Pud Stoneham accompanying
them.</p>

<p>It must have been about midnight when Nestor
was awakened by hearing voices in the room next
to his. At first he paid no attention to them, for
he was sleepy. But he sat up suddenly when he
heard some one say:</p>

<p>“They’re on the trail of a rich gold mine. I
know, for I heard the old man talking about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you sure, Bill?” asked a second voice,
which Nestor recognized as Noddy’s.</p>

<p>“Sure as I am that my name is Berry,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Then, count me in on the game,” said a third
man, whom the miner had no difficulty in knowing
was Pud Stoneham. “I’ve got money. We’ll
go in this together and win out. I owe that miner
something for insulting me, an’ I’ll pay him back,
too!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br />
<small>NODDY STEALS A MARCH.</small></h2>


<p>Nestor sat up in bed, listening with all his
might. But though he could hear a murmur of
voices in the next room, and though he was certain
Noddy and his companions were plotting against
him and his friends, the miner could hear nothing
more definite.</p>

<p>“Forewarned is forearmed,” he said, softly.
“We’ll see who’ll win out, Pud Stoneham!”</p>

<p>Nestor was up early the next morning. The
weather had cleared and it was a beautiful day.
The boys came down to breakfast with heavy eyes,
for they had slept soundly. Professor Snodgrass,
too, had arisen early, and was already searching
for rare bugs.</p>

<p>“I want to get a red tree-toad,” he explained, as
he strolled up at the sound of the breakfast gong,
“but I am afraid they are not to be had.”</p>

<p>Suddenly he grabbed Ned’s arm as the boy was
walking toward the automobile shed.</p>

<p>“One moment, I beg of you!” exclaimed the
professor. “Steady now! Ah! I have the beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
He was right on the back of your neck!” And he
reached over and took from Ned’s coat a small
insect.</p>

<p>“It’s an extremely choice specimen of a sand
flea,” said the professor, proudly, popping
the little animal into a glass case. “I hope
I did not discommode you in removing it from
you.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” laughed Ned, and the others
smiled at the simple earnestness of the bug collector.</p>

<p>“I want to have a talk with you boys after breakfast,”
spoke Nestor.</p>

<p>His grave manner somewhat alarmed them, and
they started to ask questions, but he would say
nothing until after the meal. Then he told about
what he had heard.</p>

<p>“What worries me,” said the miner, “is that I
saw about the hotel a fellow that tried to follow
me an’ my pardner one day, and locate the lost
mine. This chap’s name is Tom Dalsett, and I
saw him talking to Stoneham, the gambler, just before
we came in to breakfast. Some mischief is
in the wind when two such fellows whisper together.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they will try to get to the mine
ahead of us?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I haven’t a doubt of it,” replied the miner.
“We’ve got to look sharp from now on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Had we better start right away?” inquired
Ned.</p>

<p>“It will do no harm to wait until the roads dry
up a bit,” was Nestor’s opinion. “In the meanwhile,
see to the machine. Look over every part.
They may have damaged it during the night. See
to your guns, too. We’re going to have trouble
from now on, or my name isn’t Jim Nestor.”</p>

<p>His words rather alarmed the boys, but they
were not going to back out now, and rather relished,
than otherwise, a conflict with their old
enemy, Noddy Nixon.</p>

<p>Jerry went to the shed where the automobile had
been left for the night. As he opened the door he
uttered a cry of surprise.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, have they taken our machine?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, they haven’t done that, but they’ve skipped
in their own,” said Jerry. “I wonder if they have
done any mischief to ours?”</p>

<p>“That gang has stolen a march on us, all right,”
spoke Nestor. “They’ve gone on ahead. Well,
they may get to the mine first, but we’ll give them
the hardest kind of a fight for the possession of it.
I’m not going to lose a fortune if I can help it.”</p>

<p>Jerry soon ascertained that the red machine was
not damaged. Nestor made inquiries and learned
that the other party had left before daybreak, Pud
Stoneham accompanying them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“What became of that chap with one eye and a
scar on his left cheek?” asked Nestor of the hotel
clerk, the description fitting Dalsett.</p>

<p>“Oh, he went off with the others in the gasolene
gig this morning,” was the reply.</p>

<p>It was plain now that Noddy and his gang were
going to make a bold strike to discover the lost
mine ahead of Nestor and his friends. How the
Cresville bully had trailed the Motor Boys as far
as he had was somewhat of a mystery, though it
was afterward learned that he had been closer behind
them after they left Chicago than they supposed.
The meeting at the hotel was an accident,
though.</p>

<p>A stiff breeze sprang up, and soon dried the
muddy roads. An early dinner was eaten and once
more the party started forward, this time in pursuit
of Noddy.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad to have to leave without getting
that red tree-toad,” said Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“We’ll take you to a place where you can get
horned toads,” said Nestor.</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be fine!” exclaimed the naturalist,
with a boy’s enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The roads were none of the best, and the auto
could not be speeded with safety. Nestor explained
that the best plan would be to steer straight
south for a while, after reaching New Mexico, and
skirt around the edge of the mountain range,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
rather than attempt to make their way across the
Rockies.</p>

<p>“It will take a little longer,” he said, “but sometimes
the longest way ’round is the shortest way
home. We’ll aim for Messilla, which is not far
from El Paso, and it’s somewhat civilized there,
so we can get supplies if we need ’em.”</p>

<p>The boys voted this plan a good one. By noon
the auto had crossed the narrow stretch of land
which is part of Indian Territory, lying between
Texas and Colorado. Then they were in the big
State of Texas, and, when night came on, they
found themselves on a vast plain.</p>

<p>“It’s a case of camp out to-night,” said the
miner. “Now we’ll see what sort of stuff you boys
are made of.”</p>

<p>But if Nestor expected to find the Motor Boys
tenderfeet, he was mistaken. They had camped
out too many times before not to know what
to do.</p>

<p>The auto was run under the brow of a little hill,
and Jerry took charge of things. Bob gathered
wood for a fire and Ned went on a hunt for water.
He found a little stream that answered admirably.
Jerry got out the coffee-pot and frying-pan, and
soon had supper cooking.</p>

<p>There was fried canned chicken, with crisp slices
of bacon, some thick biscuits, a jar of pickles and
steaming hot coffee ready in a few minutes. Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
got out the tin dishes, and, seating themselves on
the ground, the adventurers made a hearty meal.</p>

<p>“Well, I must give you boys credit for knowin’
a wrinkle or two,” spoke Nestor. “I couldn’t have
done any better myself.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing I bought some of those canned
goods,” said Jerry. “I thought that would be
better than depending on what we could hunt.”</p>

<p>Supper over, and the things put away, the boys
got out their blankets in readiness for the night.
Nestor lighted his pipe and was puffing away, while
in the fast-gathering dusk Professor Snodgrass
went searching for rare specimens. He was successful
in capturing two odd grass snakes, and
seemed quite delighted. Then, as night settled
down, each one rolled himself up in his blanket
and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Ned awoke first the next morning, and soon had
the fire going and coffee made. The aromatic smell
of the beverage greeted the others as they roused
themselves, and soon a simple but satisfying
breakfast was served. Then the journey
was continued.</p>

<p>It was a fine day, and the adventurers breathed
in great whiffs of the pure air as their car dashed
along. They passed through one or two small
settlements, but inquiries failed to develop any
traces of Noddy and his companions.</p>

<p>“They may be going straight over the mountains,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
said Nestor. “Well, even if they do I
think we’ll beat them in the race for the mine.
Mountain climbing is mighty onsartin’ in one of
these machines.”</p>

<p>But, had they only known it, Noddy and his
gang were not aiming for the mountains, and were
but a little way in advance of our friends. However,
the Motor Boys soon learned, to their cost,
where their enemy was.</p>

<p>It was well along in the afternoon, and dinner
had been eaten at a rude shack of a hotel in a
small village, that the auto was skimming along,
due south. Off to the right were the foothills of
the mighty Rocky Mountains, while to the left
was a vast rolling plain. Jerry was steering, with
Bob on the seat beside him, while in the rear were
the others, Professor Snodgrass busily engaged in
sorting over some of his specimens.</p>

<p>All at once a low, rumbling sound was heard.</p>

<p>“Is that thunder?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Can’t be,” replied Nestor. “There’s not a
cloud in the sky.” Then he stood up and glanced
behind him.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” he yelled. “Put on all the speed
you’ve got!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Matter?” shouted the miner. “There’s a herd
of stampeded cattle coming straight for us. If
they’re not turned aside they’ll go over us like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
locomotive over a fly! Quick! Turn over toward
the hills! Maybe we can escape them!”</p>

<p>In terror, the boys looked behind them. Coming
on with a mad rush, with a thunder of thousands
of hoofs, and deep-mouthed bellows, were the
steers, galloping like the wind!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a><br />
<small>IN THE NICK OF TIME.</small></h2>


<p>Jerry headed the machine toward the foothills.
Once among them the adventurers might escape.
The auto was going almost at full speed, swaying
from side to side on the rough road. Nestor, who
was keeping watch of the herd, cried out:</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s no use. They have turned and
are right after us!”</p>

<p>The steers had changed their course to follow
the red auto, which they probably took for an
enemy. The thunder of their hoofs came nearer.</p>

<p>Fast as the auto was going, its speed was not
enough to take it out of reach of the infuriated
animals, for the rough prairie was retarding it,
but it was just the kind of country the cattle loved.</p>

<p>Even Nestor, familiar as he was with danger,
seemed much alarmed at the plight. The boys’
hearts were well-nigh terror-stricken, but as for
Professor Snodgrass, he did not appear at all
frightened. He still kept on sorting his specimens.</p>

<p>The auto topped a little hill, having to slow up a
bit at the grade. Down it went on the other side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
but still the steers came on. A long level stretch
of country appeared.</p>

<p>“We ought to be able to get away from them
here!” cried Jerry, turning on more gasolene and
increasing the current from the batteries. The auto
seemed to jump forward.</p>

<p>“Look out! Stop!” yelled Nestor, seizing Jerry
by the arm.</p>

<p>“We can’t! We’ll be killed if we do!” shouted
the boy, thinking the miner had lost his head
through fear.</p>

<p>“And we’ll be dashed to death if we keep on!
We’re running straight for a precipice three hundred
feet high! Shut down the machine or we’ll
go over the cliff!”</p>

<p>With a yank at the levers, Jerry turned off the
power and put on the brakes. And it was only
just in time, for, not one hundred feet ahead, the
prairie came to an abrupt end, terminating in a
sheer bluff, over which the auto and those in it
would have been dashed had not the miner’s practiced
eye told him what to expect. He recognized
the conformation of the land and knew what was
coming.</p>

<p>The adventurers were now between two dangers.
They could not go on because of the precipice, and
their escape to the rear was cut off by the maddened
steers that now were but a quarter of a mile away,
thundering on fiercely. To turn to the left or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
right was impossible, as the line of cattle was a
curving one, like a pair of horns, and to go to
either side meant to run straight into the midst of
the beasts.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of the machine and shoot as many
as we can!” cried Ned, drawing his revolver.
“Maybe we can scare them away!”</p>

<p>“Don’t think of it!” exclaimed Nestor. “Cattle
are used to seeing men only on horseback or in
wagons. Once on the ground we’d be trampled
under foot in an instant. Our only hope is to stay
in the machine. It will protect us somewhat when
they rush over us.”</p>

<p>“Shall we shoot?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Our only chance is to turn them to one side, and
shooting at them may do it,” replied the miner.
“Get ready and we’ll all fire at once.”</p>

<p>Each one drew his revolver, even Professor
Snodgrass taking an extra one Nestor had. The
cattle were now about eight hundred feet away.</p>

<p>“Fire!” cried Nestor.</p>

<p>The five revolvers spurted slivers of flame,
smoke and bullets. In rapid succession every chamber
was emptied, but the rush of the steers was not
checked. In fact, none of the cattle seemed to
have been killed, or, if any were, they fell down and
were trampled under the hoofs of the others.</p>

<p>“I guess we’re done for!” groaned Nestor.
“Crouch down on the bottom of the car!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The galloping animals were almost at the auto.
Suddenly there sounded a fusillade of shots,
mingled with wild yells. Jerry peered up over the
edge of his seat. He saw a man on a horse, riding
straight across in front of the line of cattle. In
one hand the stranger held a big revolver, which he
fired right into the faces of the steers. In the
other he held his coat, which he was waving like a
flag.</p>

<p>At the same time he was yelling like a man gone
mad. The reins of his horse lay loose on the animal’s
neck, but the beast knew what was expected
of him.</p>

<p>It seemed that the stranger would be knocked
down and trampled under thousands of sharp
hoofs. But he did not seem afraid, riding closer
and closer to the line of steers. He emptied one
revolver and drew another, never ceasing to yell
or wave his coat.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with wild bellows, the leaders of the
cattle turned. They were frightened at the strange
figure before them. For a few seconds there was
great confusion amid the mass of steers. Those behind
the line of leaders tried to go straight ahead,
but the latter, once having made up their minds
that they would turn to the left did so.</p>

<p>Then, like sheep following the bell-wether of the
flock, the beasts took after their leaders. <a href="#image03">They
rushed to one side, thundering past</a> within twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
feet of <a href="#image03">the auto</a>, while the stranger, pulling up his
horse, still continued to wave his coat and shout.</p>

</div>

<p>“He’s saved our lives!” exclaimed Nestor.
“He’s stampeded the cattle away from us in the
nick of time!”</p>

<p>On and on galloped the steers until the last one
disappeared over the rolling hills of the prairie.
Then the man on the horse rode over to the auto.</p>

<p>“Howdy!” he called.</p>

<p>“Howdy!” replied Nestor.</p>

<p>“Got ye in kind of a tight place, didn’t they?”
went on the horseman.</p>

<p>“We would have been killed only for you,”
spoke Jerry and his voice told how thankful he
was.</p>

<p>“Oh, shoo! That wa’n’t nothin’,” replied the
stranger. “I seen ye comin’ up in that there shebang
of yours an’ then I seen the cows chasin’ ye.
I was a leetle afraid ye’d go over the cliff, but ye
stopped in time. Then I see it was up to me to stop
them critters, an’ I done it.”</p>

<p>“Lucky for us you did,” put in Nestor.</p>

<p>“I happened to be out huntin’,” went on the
horseman, “or I wouldn’t have seen ye. I know
cattle an’ their ways an’ I knowed there was only
one way to head ’em off, an’ that was to skeer ’em.”</p>

<p>“I’m Jim Nestor,” said the miner, and he told
the names of his companions.</p>

<p>“Glad to meet ye,” said the horseman, dismounting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and shaking hands with each one. “I’m
Hank Broswick.”</p>

<p>Nestor told the hunter something of the trip
they were making, and Broswick in turn related
how he was a free-lance hunter, roving over the
prairies and among the mountains as suited his
whims.</p>

<p>“Had yer suppers?” Broswick asked.</p>

<p>“No; an’ I don’t see any place around here to
git ’em,” spoke Nestor. “We’ve got some grub,
though, an’ we’d be pleased to have your company.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I can add my share to the meal,”
replied Broswick. “I’d jest shot some prairie
chickens afore ye come up, an’ we’ll roast ’em.”</p>

<p>While he went over to where he had left the
fowls, Jerry backed the auto, turned it around, and
sent it down the hill to the level plain.</p>

<p>“It’s a case of camp out again to-night,” observed
Nestor.</p>

<p>“That suits me,” spoke Ned, and the other boys
agreed with him.</p>

<p>A fire was soon made, the prairie chickens were
prepared for roasting, coffee was set on to boil,
and with some tinned biscuits the adventurers
made a hearty meal.</p>

<p>Sitting around the camp-fire as night came on,
the hunter told several of his adventures while on
the trail. Once he had a terrible fight with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
grizzly bear, the scars of the combat being visible
on his face and arms.</p>

<p>“Are there any bears around here?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Not getting afraid, are you, Chunky?” queried
Ned.</p>

<p>“No; I only just wanted to know,” replied the
stout youth, looking over his shoulder in as careless
a manner as he could assume.</p>

<p>“Waal, there’s a few now an’ agin’,” answered
the hunter, “but they don’t bother me much, not
while I have this along,” and he patted a rifle
which he had left with his game before he rode
out to stampede the cattle.</p>

<p>“Are you bound for any particular place?”
asked Nestor of Hank.</p>

<p>“Nope; I’m my own boss.”</p>

<p>“Then, why not come along with us?” proposed
the miner. “We may need your help, for there’s
a bad gang ahead of us.”</p>

<p>He told something of the plans of himself and
the boys, in regard to the gold mine, and related
how there were enemies in front, and added that
he might pay the hunter for his time.</p>

<p>“I’ll go ’long!” exclaimed the hunter, after a
moment’s thought. “I used to be a prospector
myself.”</p>

<p>More fuel was heaped on the fire, the adventurers
wrapped themselves in their blankets and prepared
to spend the night in the open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>It was past midnight when Bob was suddenly
awakened by feeling some one trying to turn him
over.</p>

<p>“Go ’way,” he said, sleepily. “Let me alone.”</p>

<p>Something cold and clammy was thrust against
his face, and he heard the breathing and noted
the peculiar smell of some wild animal.</p>

<p>With a shout of terror he sat upright. In the
glow from the fire he saw, rearing up on his
haunches before him, a big, black bear!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a><br />
<small>A RUSH OF GOLD SEEKERS.</small></h2>


<p>“Help! help!” screamed Bob.</p>

<p>The bear made a dive for him and the boy cast
himself forward on his face.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What is it?” cried Hank
Broswick, springing to his feet.</p>

<p>“Indians! Indians!” exclaimed Professor Snodgrass,
rolling himself tightly up in his blanket.</p>

<p>“It isn’t Indians! It’s a bear killing Bob!”
cried Jerry.</p>

<p>The animal, with savage growls, had pounced
on the unfortunate boy and was trying to get hold
of him with the powerful claws. Bob, after his
first wild screams, became quiet, digging his fingers
into the earth to hold himself down.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! I’ll kill the brute!” cried the
hunter.</p>

<p>He had seized his ever-ready rifle and rushed
over toward the bear. But the fierce beast was so
close to Bob that Broswick could not fire without
danger of hitting the lad.</p>

<p>“Here, boy, take the gun!” yelled the hunter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Jerry. “If you see me getting the worst of it,
fire!”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m going to kill that brute with my knife!”
cried Broswick.</p>

<p>Drawing a keen blade from the sheath at his
belt, he jumped straight on the bear’s back. The
beast, with a fierce growl of rage, turned and tried
to bite the legs of the strange enemy that was
plunging something terrible and sharp into his
shoulders.</p>

<p>Ned threw some wood on the fire. It blazed up
brightly and, by the light of it, the boys and Nestor
saw the bear rear on his haunches, with Broswick
still clinging to his back.</p>

<p>The hunter had one hand clasped in the shaggy
fur of the brute, and the other was sending the
knife, again and again, into the thick skin, trying
to reach a vital spot.</p>

<p>Bob had rolled to one side, out of harm’s way,
and suffered no more than a rough mauling by the
brute. But Broswick was not to escape so easily.</p>

<p>With a sudden movement the bear turned, shook
the hunter loose, and then, before the brave fellow
could defend himself, the savage animal had
clasped him in the terrible and powerful claws.</p>

<p>“Help! He’s squeezing me to death!” Broswick
cried.</p>

<p>His arms were pinned to his sides and he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
not get a chance to use his knife, which he still
held.</p>

<p>Jerry saw his chance. Approaching close to the
bear from behind, the boy placed the muzzle of
the gun against the brute’s head.</p>

<p>There was a loud report, a last fierce growl, and
the animal, with a convulsive hug of the hunter,
dropped over, dead. Jerry had shot just in time.</p>

<p>Broswick, too, fell to the earth and at first the
boys thought he was killed. But in a little while
he arose and felt of his arms and legs.</p>

<p>“I’m all here,” he said. “Guess there ain’t much
harm done, but it was a pretty tight squeeze!”</p>

<p>“I thought you were a goner,” spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>“That ain’t nothin’,” answered the hunter. “You
ought to hev seen me fight a grizzly once!”</p>

<p>In the light of the fire, which was now blazing
brightly, it was seen that the bear was a big specimen.
As he lay stretched out on the ground he
measured eight feet from his nose to his short tail.</p>

<p>“You know I tole ye there was a few bears now
an’ agin’,” remarked the hunter, as he gave his
former foe a kick. “Waal, I reckon some of ’em
must ’a’ heard me an’ wanted to show I was tellin’
the truth,” he added, with a drawl.</p>

<p>No one felt much like sleep after this excitement,
so they sat around the camp-fire until it
began to get light. Then coffee was made, and
the hunter proceeded to skin his prize. He cut off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
some choice steaks, which were broiled over the
coals. The boys thought they had never tasted
anything so good.</p>

<p>After breakfast the tires were pumped up, the
baggage was packed into the auto and preparations
made for the start.</p>

<p>“Where’s Professor Snodgrass?” asked Ned,
noticing the absence of the naturalist. Then they
all remembered that they had not seen him since
the morning meal.</p>

<p>“He’s probably off gathering some bugs or
stones,” said Jerry. “Let’s give a yell to call him
in.”</p>

<p>In a chorus they gave a loud hallo, and in reply
received a faint call from a small ravine.</p>

<p>“He’s over there,” said Broswick, pointing in
the direction the voice had come from. “But hark!
Sounds like he was in trouble!”</p>

<p>Faintly the wind bore to the adventurers the
sound of the professor’s voice pleading with some
one.</p>

<p>“Now, please don’t!” he was saying, or rather
calling aloud. “You know you shouldn’t do that!
Let me alone, I say! Get out of my way or I’ll
throw a stone at you!”</p>

<p>“The Indians are after him!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“There are no Indians around here, Chunky,”
spoke Jerry. “You must have redskins on the
brain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Broswick and Nestor hurried over to the ravine.
As they reached it they could be heard laughing
long and heartily. Soon a small, wild goat was
seen to run from the cut, leaping away over the
plain. Out of the defile came the professor, Nestor
and Broswick.</p>

<p>“The wild goat had him treed,” spoke Nestor.</p>

<p>“Truly that was a savage brute,” said the professor.
“I was gathering some specimens, and had
my arms full, when along comes this beast, with
lowered horns, and nearly knocked me over. I
had barely time to run for my life and climb a
tree before he was after me again. His sharp
horns scraped my shoe as I climbed. There I was,
treed. I didn’t dare come down, for fear he would
eat me, or horn me to death. I don’t know what I
should have done if you gentlemen hadn’t come
along.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we only scared him away!” said Broswick.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, just a moment,” interrupted the
professor, making a quick motion toward Nestor
and picking something from his shoulder. “There,
I have it. I am very much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“What sort of game did ye git this trip?” asked
the hunter, somewhat amused at the naturalist.</p>

<p>“A rare specimen of the fly that lives in the wool
of wild goats,” replied the professor. “The insect
is very valuable. It must have jumped from the
goat to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>After a little consultation the party started off,
the auto making a pace slow enough so the hunter’s
horse could easily keep up. For several days the
journey was continued, with no accidents to mar the
way. The adventurers had reached well down into
New Mexico by this time and had about one hundred
miles farther to go before they could make
the spur of the mountain and avoid going over the
range.</p>

<p>One afternoon, following a good day’s run, Ned
brought the machine to a stop below a little hill,
where it was decided to spend the night, as the
place was sheltered.</p>

<p>Jerry happened to glance to the rear, over the
back trail, as he was getting out the supper utensils,
and uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” he asked, pointing to a long line
of men that were filing along a road that joined
the main one about where the camp was to be made.</p>

<p>“Looks like a procession,” observed Broswick.</p>

<p>“They’re miners, that’s what they are!” cried
Nestor, after a long look. “Every one has his pack
on his back, his washing-pan and his pick and
shovel.”</p>

<p>“What are they coming this way for?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“They are on the rush, seeking gold,” explained
the miner. “Word has come to the camp where
they were that rich pay-dirt has been struck in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
locality. They all want to get at it, so they pack
up and leave for the new field. Many’s the time
I’ve done it.”</p>

<p>In a little while the foremost of the miners
reached the auto camp. They seemed surprised
to see the machine, but did not stop.</p>

<p>“What’s your hurry, mate?” asked Nestor, of
one big, brawny chap who was walking fast.</p>

<p>“Want to make as many miles as I can before
sundown,” was the reply. “There’s rich diggin’s
ahead, an’ I want to stake a good claim.”</p>

<p>“Where might they be located?” asked Nestor.</p>

<p>“Why, ain’t you heard? I thought every one
had,” answered the other. “They’re in the lower
part of Arizona, in what they call the Hop Toad
District.”</p>

<p>Nestor gave a start. The miner passed on, fearful
lest even his brief stop would cost him his place
in the cavalcade.</p>

<p>“The Hop Toad District!” muttered Nestor.
“That’s the district where my lost mine is located!
I hope that hasn’t been discovered. If it has it
means all our work has gone for nothin’!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a><br />
<small>OVER THE MOUNTAINS.</small></h2>


<p>On and on the stream of miners hurried. Several
paused to stare at the automobile in wonder.
Others passed by with never a glance. One man
was mounted on a lame mule that made but little
better speed than some of the pedestrians.</p>

<p>Three men, who seemed to form a party by
themselves, came to a halt in front of the machine.
They whispered together a few moments and then
one stepped forward and addressed Nestor.</p>

<p>“Will you sell that machine for three thousand
dollars?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’m not the boss. You’ll have to speak to one
of these boys,” replied the miner.</p>

<p>“How about it?” asked the man of Jerry.</p>

<p>“I hardly believe we want to sell,” answered
the latter.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” whispered Nestor. “There’s
some game afoot. Don’t sell. There must have
been a big gold strike lately to cause this rush!”</p>

<p>The three miners saw that the boys would not
part with their machine, which the prospectors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
wanted in order to make a quick trip to the new
mining region. So they turned away and continued
afoot on the trail.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour the stream of miners continued
to march by. Then, as the last stragglers
were lost to view, Nestor said:</p>

<p>“Boys, we’re in a tight place. We’ll have to
hustle. Somehow or other news of the rich mining
region near where my mine is located has leaked
out. There’s a rush, and we’ll have to travel fast.
We can’t stick to our original plan. We’ve got
to go over the mountains.”</p>

<p>“Must we start right away?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“The sooner the better,” answered Nestor.
“We’ll have supper and travel night and day from
now on. We’ll have to race against not only Noddy
Nixon and his gang, but these miners who have
gone on ahead of us.”</p>

<p>From what was intended to be a peaceful camp,
that of the Motor Boys and their friends was
turned into a mere resting place. Every one was
filled with excitement, and Professor Snodgrass
forgot to start on a collecting tour. He did not
open his green box, and, with the others, ate a
hasty meal.</p>

<p>As soon as Jerry had finished his supper he gave
the auto a thorough overhauling. Plenty of oil
was put on the bearings, the water tank was refilled
from a convenient spring and the tires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
pumped up. Then the holder for the carbide, from
which the acetylene gas for the lamps was generated,
was packed with the chemical.</p>

<p>“I’m ready when you are,” announced Jerry.</p>

<p>By this time each one had finished his meal. The
dishes were placed in the basket, Professor Snodgrass
stowed his specimens carefully away and
Hank Broswick tightened the saddle girths on his
horse.</p>

<p>“Forward!” cried Nestor.</p>

<p>With a series of chug-chugs the machine darted
ahead. The hunter urged his horse on and the adventurers
were once more moving toward the hidden
mine. It was going to be a bright, moonlight
night, as could be told by the silver disk that was
already rising above the trees.</p>

<p>“We’ll hardly need the gas lamps,” observed
Ned.</p>

<p>“But it’s better to have them,” remarked Jerry,
who had been selected to do the steering.</p>

<p>Leaving the broad and level road that led south
over the plains, the adventurers headed due west.
In a little while it was evident that the machine
was going uphill, for the motor began puffing laboriously,
and Jerry shifted the gear to first speed.</p>

<p>“We’ve struck the foothills,” observed Nestor.
“In a short time we’ll be going up the mountain.
Then, look out!”</p>

<p>Broswick rode along just behind the machine on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
his horse. The animal was a steady trotter and
managed to keep up to the auto, which was obliged
to move slowly, as it had quite a heavy load on a
steep grade.</p>

<p>For several hours the machine kept going. All
the while the ascent became more and more steep
until, at length, the adventurers found themselves
well above the foothills and among the mountains.</p>

<p>“We’ll keep on until about ten o’clock,” said
Nestor. “Then we’ll camp for the night. We
must get some sleep or we’ll be all tired out.”</p>

<p>Up, up, up went the auto. After quite a climb
a small plateau or level stretch was reached, and
there the going was easier. Jerry took advantage
of it to run on the second gear. It was quiet, save
for the mournful hooting of an owl now and then,
as the machine made little noise, and no one felt
like talking. All at once there came from the rear
seat a strange sound.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Chunky has fallen asleep and is snoring,” answered
Broswick, who was riding beside the machine.</p>

<p>“I reckon it’s time we camped for the night,”
put in Nestor. “Here’s a good stopping place.
We’ll make an early start in the morning.”</p>

<p>The machine was halted, blankets were gotten
out and a small camp-fire started. Tired and
weary, the adventurers prepared for bed. Broswick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
who carried his blankets on his horse, said
he would stand the first watch, and Nestor agreed
to take the second, so the boys could get a full
night’s rest.</p>

<p>“I’ll do my share,” said Professor Snodgrass,
anxious to be of service.</p>

<p>But Nestor said there was no need for the naturalist
to sit up. To tell the truth, the miner was
afraid that if the professor was left on guard he
would forget what he was doing and wander off in
search of specimens.</p>

<p>Silence soon settled over the little camp in
the mountains. The three boys were slumbering
peacefully, as was the professor. Broswick sat
by the fire, keeping watch, and Nestor was rolled
up in his blanket.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from down the slope up which the
auto had come, sounded the blast of a trumpet.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Nestor, springing to his
feet, for he was a light sleeper. He came over to
where the hunter sat.</p>

<p>“Sounded like Gabriel’s trumpet,” replied the
hunter, quietly.</p>

<p>“No; it was an auto horn,” spoke Nestor. “A
machine is coming up the trail. We must watch
out. It may be Noddy Nixon and his gang.”</p>

<p>Once more silence settled down, but to the
trained ears of the miner and hunter there came the
faint throbbing that told an automobile was approaching.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Nestor loosened the revolver in his
belt and Broswick reached over for his rifle, which
he always kept near him.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the machine. It reached
the level stretch on which the adventurers were encamped
and then the speed of the engine could be
heard to increase. Nestor threw some light wood
on the fire. It blazed up brightly, and the miner
quickly drew Broswick back into the shadows of
a big oak tree.</p>

<p>“We’ll watch as they go past,” he said.</p>

<p>A minute later an auto dashed by.</p>

<p>“There they are!” exclaimed Nestor. “There’s
that gambler, Pud Stoneham, and with him is Tom
Dalsett, the man who knows where my mine is. I
wonder how they got behind us. I thought they
were ahead.”</p>

<p>“I reckon we can keep ’em behind if we want
to,” whispered Broswick. He raised his gun.</p>

<p>“Hold on! we don’t want to murder any one!”
exclaimed Nestor, in a whisper, knocking the
weapon up.</p>

<p>He was too late, as the hunter had fired.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t goin’ to do any damage,” spoke the old
man. “I only aimed to bust a tire. However, you
spoiled my mark. The bullet went over their heads.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were goin’ to shoot one of them,”
said Nestor.</p>

<p>Noddy, who, from the brief glimpse Nestor had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
could be seen at the steering wheel, increased his
speed at the sound of the report, as could be told
by the faster explosions of the motor. The noise
of the rifle going off awoke Jerry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he cried, sitting up.</p>

<p>“Your friend Noddy just passed by,” replied
Nestor, “and the hunter gave him a salute.”</p>

<p>“I thought he was far away,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>There was nothing that could be done, and the
camp again settled down to quietness and slumber.
There were no more disturbances, and at midnight
Nestor relieved Broswick. Almost before the boys
knew it morning had come.</p>

<p>Then, after breakfast, they were off once more.</p>

<p>There were no signs of Noddy’s machine save
the marks of the broad tires in the dust of the road.
Leaving the plateau the adventurers were soon
mounting toward the clouds again.</p>

<p>All the morning they hurried forward as fast
as the auto could be urged. Broswick’s horse kept
well to the trail, for it was used to mountain climbing.
At noon a stop was made beside a swiftly
running brook and dinner was eaten. Then, after
a rest beneath the trees, the journey was resumed.</p>

<p>About five o’clock another halt was made for
supper, thirty miles having been reeled off during
the afternoon.</p>

<p>“We’ll do a bit of traveling as we did last
night,” said Nestor.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a><br />
<small>A TRICK OF THE ENEMY.</small></h2>


<p>The gas and oil lamps were lighted, and, as the
sun sank to rest behind the hills, the auto began
the night trip. The way was still upward, for the
summit of the mountains had not yet been reached.
Ned was steering and Jerry was on the seat beside
him.</p>

<p>The machine topped a long rise and came to the
brow of a small incline, the descent of which, on
the other side, was quite steep.</p>

<p>It was now dark, for the moon had gone behind
a cloud. The road was not of the best, and
Ned had the machine pretty well under control.
Down it went on the slope.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jerry gave a cry and reached over to
shut off the power.</p>

<p>“Jam on the brakes!” he cried to Ned.</p>

<p>The steersman obeyed, and, with a grinding
sound, the auto came to a halt, with a sort of jar.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Nestor.</p>

<p>“Some obstruction on the road; looks like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
log,” answered Jerry. “I just happened to see it
in time.”</p>

<p>He got out and ran ahead.</p>

<p>“It’s a tree cut down right across the path,” he
called back. “A big one, too. If we’d hit it,
running as we were, we’d have gone to smash.”</p>

<p>They all got out of the car and gathered about
the obstruction. Broswick alighted from his horse
and made a close inspection.</p>

<p>“This was done on purpose,” he declared. “It
has been freshly cut and was chopped on the side
next to the road so’s to fall right across an’ block
our way.”</p>

<p>“I wonder who did it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“There’s only one gang who could have an object
in such a trick as this,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Who?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon’s crowd. They want to delay us
as much as possible so they can reach the mine
first.”</p>

<p>“I believe Jerry is right,” put in Nestor. “This
is one of the enemy’s tricks, all right.”</p>

<p>For a little while the adventurers stood and
looked at the tree that obstructed their further
progress.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s to be done?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“It’s too big for us to lift out of the way,” said
Bob. “We’ll have to wait until morning and then
go get some axes and chop it in two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t do that,” exclaimed Professor Snodgrass,
so earnestly that the boys thought he might
have some other plan to propose.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Because there may be some valuable specimens
of insects on that tree, little green or brown toads,
katydids or other things. Let it stay there until
morning so I may gather them.”</p>

<p>“The tree is likely to stay there until morning,
all right enough,” observed Nestor, “so you’ll have
all the time you want, Professor.”</p>

<p>“There’s no need of delay,” spoke Jerry, suddenly.</p>

<p>“How you goin’ to git rid of the tree?” asked
Nestor.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>He ran to the back of the auto, took out a long,
stout rope and fastened this to the tree, near
the branch end. The other end of the cable Jerry
brought back to the machine. This he now tied
to the rear axle of the automobile, and then,
getting into the front seat, he turned the machine
around.</p>

<p>Gradually increasing the speed, he sent the auto
ahead. The rope tightened, there was a straining,
cracking sound and the tree was pulled to one side
of the road by the power of the auto. The thoroughfare
was left free for passage.</p>

<p>“I guess they didn’t think of that,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Jerry, as he replaced the rope and turned the machine
around. “Now we can go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Good for you!” cried Nestor. “We’ll beat
’em yet, an’ at their own game!”</p>

<p>They piled into the auto, and with Jerry at the
wheel, went forward again, Broswick’s horse keeping
up. They traveled for about an hour longer
and then Nestor suggested that as they had reached
a good spot it might be wise to camp there for the
rest of the night.</p>

<p>It was not long before every one was snoring in
slumber. Ned was the first one to awake, and he
did so as the result of a vivid dream he had that he
was sliding downhill on top of a barrel, when it
collapsed and threw him into a snow-bank.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes to find the ground all white
about him, and about three inches of snow covering
his rubber blanket.</p>

<p>“Where are we?” he called out, his voice awakening
the others.</p>

<p>“A snow squall!” cried Broswick. “I thought
we were gittin’ high enough to have ’em. Waal, it
won’t amount to much.”</p>

<p>“Are snow storms common here the end of September?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“They are when you git high enough in the
mountains,” replied the hunter. “Many’s the
night I’ve gone to bed thinkin’ it was summer, to
wake up an’ find it winter, an’ me sleepin’ under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
a foot of snow. The storms come up so easy you
don’t know anythin’ about ’em.”</p>

<p>“Will it last long?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No; it’ll melt when the sun strikes it,” was the
answer. “But snow or no snow, we must have
breakfast.”</p>

<p>Broswick scraped away a place amid the white
blanket and found some wood. A blaze was soon
kindled, and the appetizing smell of coffee filled
the crisp air. A hasty but substantial meal was
made, and then the travelers, urged on by the call
of gold in the mine they were striving to reach,
took up their journey again.</p>

<p>As Broswick had said, as soon as the sun rose
the snow began to melt and soon the landscape
showed no signs of the winter costume it had masqueraded
in. The adventurers were now close to
the top of the mountain, and would shortly begin
descending on the other slope. They had dinner
beside a swift, cold brook, from which Broswick
caught several large trout that made an excellent
and very welcome addition to the meal, broiled as
they were over the coals.</p>

<p>It was late that afternoon when the hunter, who
was riding somewhat in the rear, came galloping
up on his horse.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’re in for it,” he said.</p>

<p>“In for what?” asked Nestor.</p>

<p>“A rippin’ old thunder storm,” was the answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
“The clouds back there are as black as ink an’ the
wind’s drivin’ ’em right this way. If I know anythin’
of signs, an’ I ought to, considerin’ I’ve
hunted in these mountains for nigh onto twenty
years, we’re goin’ to have a regular rip-snorter.”</p>

<p>“Snow one day and a thunder storm the next,”
observed Jerry. “This is a queer country.”</p>

<p>Events soon proved the old hunter was right.
The wind began to blow a regular gale and the
clouds made the sky almost as dark as night. The
auto was going downhill; Jerry was taking it along
as easily as he could.</p>

<p>Suddenly the storm burst with a terrific peal of
thunder that accompanied a blinding flash of lightning.
It seemed to shake the very earth. Then
came a regular deluge of rain.</p>

<p>“Run the machine under a tree,” advised Nestor.
“We’ll be washed away if we stay in the
road.”</p>

<p>“There’s a good place, just ahead!” shouted
Broswick. “Under the oak. Leave the auto there
and run for the cave!”</p>

<p>“What cave?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“There’s one on the left side of the road, a little
above the tree,” said Broswick. “I’ve stayed in
it often when I was caught in a storm. It’ll hold
all of us an’ the horse.”</p>

<p>The machine was halted beneath the oak. Then,
after rubber blankets had been spread to keep dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the baggage in the auto, the adventurers raced
for the cave, led by Broswick.</p>

<p>They found the cavern to be a dry, roomy one, a
natural hole scooped out of the side of the mountain.
Once inside, the war of the elements could not
harm them. They drew back from the mouth of
the cave and listened to the heavy rumble of thunder
and watched the brilliant lightning.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the very flood-gates were opened.
The wind blew a regular hurricane, and the lightning
was incessant.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a dull rumbling and the
cave was jarred by a shock. Then it grew as black
as night.</p>

<p>“That struck somewhere!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“And near here!” exclaimed Broswick. “I’m
afraid it was too close for comfort.”</p>

<p>“Are we in any danger?” asked Professor Snodgrass,
calmly.</p>

<p>Broswick had groped his way forward. He
seemed to be fumbling in the darkness at the mouth
of the cave.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” shouted Nestor.</p>

<p>“A rock has fallen and closed the mouth of the
cavern!” cried the hunter.</p>

<small>THE AUTO STOLEN.</small></h2>


<p>For a few moments the silence of despair was
on every one. The knowledge that they were imprisoned
in the cave came as a terrible shock.</p>

<p>“Is there no way out?” asked Nestor.</p>

<p>“Now don’t you folks go to worryin’,” spoke
Broswick, in a more cheerful voice than seemed
warranted under the circumstances. “I’ve been in
tighter places than this, an’ come out on top!”</p>

<p>“But we’re buried!” cried Professor Snodgrass,
who, for once, seemed to have forgotten all about
his beloved specimens.</p>

<p>“That’s nothin’,” spoke Broswick. “You thought
you was all goners when them cattle was comin’
after you, but I got you out, an’ I’m goin’ to do
the same now!”</p>

<p>“You can’t burrow out like a rabbit,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a little instrument here that will help
me,” said the hunter. “I never travel without a
spade on my saddle. I’ve lost too many rabbits
an’ woodchucks through not havin’ the means to
dig ’em out, so I always carry a shovel along. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
reckon it will come in handy. If I only had a
light now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No need to worry about that,” put in Nestor.
“It would be a pretty poor miner that traveled
without a bit of candle and some matches with him.
I always go prepared for emergencies.”</p>

<p>He struck a match, a yellow glow filled the cave,
and soon a candle gave good illumination. The
boys could see that the cavern was of large size.</p>

<p>“I’ve often stayed in here to keep out the rain,”
said Broswick, as he got his spade, “but I never
was ketched like this before.”</p>

<p>Guided by the candle, the hunter went to the
mouth of the cave and began digging away the
mass of earth and rocks that had slid down and obstructed
the opening.</p>

<p>“Goin’ to be quite a job,” remarked the miner,
as he looked over the mass. “It’ll take a good
while.”</p>

<p>“There’s plenty of us to do the work,” replied
Broswick.</p>

<p>He attacked the pile and made the dirt fly. After
he had labored fifteen minutes Nestor relieved him.
The miner, from his experience in digging into the
earth, made more progress than had the hunter.
Nestor kept at it for more than half an hour, refusing
to yield the spade to any one.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, when he stopped to rest, “I’ve
made quite a hole.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys and Professor Snodgrass took turns,
and then Nestor went at it again.</p>

<p>“I wish I had a drink,” remarked the miner.
“This is dry work.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ easier,” said Broswick. He took a
second candle, which the miner had, and walked to
the rear of the cave.</p>

<p>In a little while he returned with a big gourd
full of cold water.</p>

<p>“What sort of a magician are you?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“There’s a spring back there,” explained Broswick.
“Many’s the time I’ve taken a drink at it
and the last time I was here I brought this gourd
for a dipper. Now it comes in handy.”</p>

<p>Each one took a draught of the cool water and
felt the better for it. Then Nestor insisted that
he was going to continue the digging. The others
wanted to relieve him, but he would not let them.
He plied the spade vigorously and the dirt was
scattered to one side.</p>

<p>“Light! Light!” the miner cried, suddenly. “I
can see light! We’re nearly out!”</p>

<p>A few more strokes of the shovel made the opening
larger and then, with a shout and hurrah, the
imprisoned adventurers rushed forward.</p>

<p>“Why! Why! It’s night!” exclaimed Bob, as
he emerged from the cavern and saw the stars
shining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course it is,” answered Nestor. “It was
late afternoon when we took shelter in the cave,
and we were there more than three hours.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re out now,” said Jerry. “I wonder
if the auto was damaged.”</p>

<p>The storm had ceased and the night was a fine,
clear one. The moon was shining from a cloudless
sky and thousands of stars were out. Jerry ran
on ahead to the tree under which the auto had been
left, for the machine was his chief concern.</p>

<p>He paused as he reached the spot. Then he
rubbed his eyes and wondered if he was seeing
straight. He even pinched himself to see if he
was awake.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned, who was following
close behind his chum.</p>

<p>“The auto is gone!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Gone?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Stolen!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed Nestor, running up.</p>

<p>Jerry pointed under the tree. There was not
any sign of an automobile.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” observed Broswick. “It
couldn’t fly away, that’s sure.” He led his horse
from the cave up to the road and stooped down to
examine the path closely.</p>

<p>“Let’s have one of those candles,” the hunter
called to Nestor. Lighting the wick the old man
examined the road with care, moving about in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
circle and then going backward and forward for
quite a distance.</p>

<p>“Well?” inquired Nestor, when the hunter
straightened up.</p>

<p>“Some one came along in another auto while we
were in the cave,” said the hunter, “pulled up here
alongside of yours, hitched on to it and pulled it
away, or else rode off in it.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I haven’t hunted an’ trapped twenty years for
nothin’, young man,” was the answer. “I can see
the tracks your machine made as it stopped under a
tree. Then along comes another machine, with
tires a leetle mite smaller’n yours. Auto No. 2
stops. Some one gits out from it an’ looks over
your auto, for I kin see marks of hob-nailed shoes,
an’ none of us wear ’em.”</p>

<p>“Hob-nails, did you say, eh?” here interrupted
Nestor.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said.”</p>

<p>“Then Tom Dalsett has been here.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Look an’ see if the soles of the hob-nailed shoes
didn’t have a cross in each one.”</p>

<p>“They did,” replied the hunter, inspecting the
tracks.</p>

<p>“Then it’s Tom Dalsett for sure. He always
wore shoes like that, an’ I seen ’em on him when he
was at Dead Man’s Gulch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then Noddy and his gang have stolen our
auto!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s about it,” assented Nestor. “However,
we mustn’t give up yet. We’ll take after ’em.”</p>

<p>“Not much chance of getting them, though,”
put in Ned.</p>

<p>“You’re welcome to my horse,” said Broswick.
“He ain’t very fast, but he’s better than nothin’.”</p>

<p>“There’s no use doin’ anythin’ to-night,” was
the miner’s opinion. “We’d only get lost on the
road, and I don’t know but what we’re lost already.
We’ll have to camp until mornin’.”</p>

<p>After some consideration this was voted the
best thing to do. It was a sorrowful band of adventurers
that gathered about the fire which Broswick
made, for the hearts of the boys were dispirited
over the theft of their machine, and the men
sympathized with them.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the hunter had some bacon left,
and a meal, such as it was, the travelers made on
this. Then, selecting the driest places they could
find, they prepared to spend the night in the open,
without coverings. It was cold, but by keeping a
good fire going some comfort was had.</p>

<p>When the sun rose the adventurers got up,
stretched themselves and wondered what they were
going to do for breakfast.</p>

<p>“Leave it to me,” said Broswick. “I’m used
to providing meals.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>He was gone some little time, and when he came
back he had several plump birds. These were
cleaned and were soon roasting over the fire on
sticks. It was a good deal better meal than might
have been expected under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Then, with the hunter riding his horse, and the
others following, the journey in search of the
stolen auto was begun. The marks made by the
broad tires of the two machines could be plainly
seen.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t care if I had my valuable specimens,”
wailed Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“We’ll git ’em, an’ the auto, too,” said Broswick.
“Don’t you worry.”</p>

<p>They had covered several miles and were descending
a long hill, when Jerry called out:</p>

<p>“What’s that ahead, there?”</p>

<p>They all stopped and peered down the road.</p>

<p>“There are two autos!” cried Nestor. “One
looks like ours. I’m going to see about it.”</p>

<p>And he started off on a run.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a><br />
<small>ATTACKED BY INDIANS.</small></h2>


<p>“Here, come back!” yelled Broswick.</p>

<p>“What for?” shouted Nestor.</p>

<p>“Take my horse,” said the hunter. “That’s better
than going afoot.”</p>

<p>Nestor returned, mounted the animal and set
off at a gallop toward the two autos, which were
down in the valley.</p>

<p>“He’ll never catch them,” said Bob, in a despairing
tone.</p>

<p>“You let him alone,” came from Broswick.
“He’ll git ’em, all right. There’s some trouble
down there. One machine can’t go.”</p>

<p>“How can you tell?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’ve got sharp eyes, boy,” was the answer. “I
use ’em in my business.”</p>

<p>In fact, as the boys observed closely, they could
see that the two machines were not moving. They
could also note men walking about the cars.</p>

<p>“Something’s out of kilter,” said Ned. “I guess
they found plenty of trouble running two machines.
I’ll bet one of ’em is ours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>They watched Nestor descend the slope and approach
the cars. As he came closer to them it was
observed that there was some commotion among
the persons grouped around the machines. They
saw the miner raise his hand in the air, and little
clouds of smoke arose.</p>

<p>“He’s firing over their heads!” cried Broswick.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, the persons down in the valley,
who, as the boys afterward learned, were Noddy
Nixon and his gang, made a rush for the head auto,
jumped into it and made off at top speed.</p>

<p>Nestor rode up to the remaining machine and
waved his hat back to his friends. Taking this
as a signal that all was right, they hurried
forward.</p>

<p>“It was them, all right!” cried Nestor, when
Jerry and the others had joined him. “I scared
them off by firing in the air. There seemed to be
something the matter with our auto, for they were
trying to fix it.”</p>

<p>The boys were worried lest some harm had befallen
their machine. Jerry made an examination,
however, and found things in good shape. There
was some damage, and a battery wire had become
disconnected, which had brought the machine to a
stop, thus foiling the plans of Noddy.</p>

<p>“That was a lucky break for us,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“You bet it was, Chunky,” agreed Ned. “If we
hadn’t recovered the auto we would have had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
walk back home, and home is a good ways from
here.”</p>

<p>Repairs to the machine were quickly made, and
then, with light hearts, the adventurers took their
places and started forward once again.</p>

<p>Nothing in the car had been disturbed, and even
the collection of insects made by Professor Snodgrass
had not been harmed. The steady chug-chug
and puff-puff of the motor was heard as the adventurers
moved on up the mountain.</p>

<p>They stopped for dinner on top of a little
hill in the midst of a grove of trees. A fire was
kindled, coffee made, and some canned provisions
set out.</p>

<p>“This is something like,” observed Bob, smacking
his lips over some preserved tongue.</p>

<p>“I’d have given five dollars for a cup of coffee
last night,” spoke Nestor.</p>

<p>“Me, too,” said the hunter.</p>

<p>“I am so thankful my specimens are safe I could
go without eating for a week,” put in Professor
Snodgrass, at which they all laughed.</p>

<p>Taking a comfortable rest under the trees until
the afternoon sun went down a little, the adventurers
were thoroughly enjoying the pleasant day.
Suddenly Broswick started up.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Nestor, viewing with alarm
the look of fear on the hunter’s face.</p>

<p>“Indians!” was the answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“You don’t mean real Indians?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I do. There’s a reservation of
some kind about fifty miles from here, and they
break loose every now and again.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think some are loose now?”</p>

<p>“Hear ’em yellin’ an’ screechin’!” said the
hunter, raising his hand to caution silence.</p>

<p>Straining their ears the adventurers noted the
faint sound of some weird chant borne to them on
the east wind. Then, as they watched, they saw,
coming over the slope of the hill, a band of redskins,
mounted on ponies.</p>

<p>“Hurry to the auto!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>He ran for the machine, followed by Jerry and
Bob. Broswick picked up his gun and looked to
the loading of it, as Nestor did to his revolvers,
but neither of the men offered to retreat. Professor
Snodgrass was intent on capturing some kind
of grasshoppers, and did not seem to care whether
there were Indians about or not. More and more
of the savages came into view.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better skip?” asked Nestor of the
hunter.</p>

<p>“There are a few more than I reckoned on,” was
the reply. “I guess we may as well skedaddle if we
don’t want trouble. I don’t know how my nag will
run, compared to the Indian ponies, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Better get in the auto,” suggested Nestor. “It
will hold six on a pinch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time Ned was frantically cranking up
the machine. But, though he turned the flywheel
with all his strength, while Bob attended to the
spark and gasolene levers, the machine would not
start.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Jerry, who had delayed,
to pick up some of the baggage that was unloaded
for dinner.</p>

<p>“She’s stuck!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry sprang to the cranking handle. His success
was no better than Ned’s. There were a few
faint compressions, but that was all.</p>

<p>“Better start if you’re goin’ to,” said Broswick,
coming up. “They’re almost here now.”</p>

<p>“We can’t start!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to fight!” observed Broswick,
coolly.</p>

<p>Suddenly the air was filled with fierce howls and
yells.</p>

<p>“You boys git in the back part of the machine,”
cautioned the hunter. “We men will attend to
the redskins. Maybe they are only off on a holiday
junket, account of bein’ paid off by the Government.
In that case they may let us alone. But
they might be ugly, an’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Just then a bullet, with an angry zip, passed over
Broswick’s head.</p>

<p>“They’re out fer business an’ not fun!” he exclaimed.
At the same instant he threw up his rifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and fired. A howl of pain came in answer, and
one Indian fell from his horse.</p>

<p>“I only took him in the leg,” said the hunter,
grimly. “No use killin’ any if we can avoid
it.”</p>

<p>Jerry, Bob and Ned sank down in the tonneau.
Nestor and the hunter lined up in front of the auto
and stood with ready weapons. Professor Snodgrass,
with a revolver, which Nestor had given
him, seemed more afraid of the weapon than of the
Indians.</p>

<p>Then, with savage yells, the band of redskins,
who, as it afterward developed, had gone on a
rampage from their reservation because they were
dissatisfied with the Government rations, closed
around the auto. They fired their guns off as fast
as they could load them.</p>

<p>But, either because they were poor shots, or because
they didn’t want to hit the adventurers, the
Indians did no damage. Several bullets came uncomfortably
close, and one or two grazed the auto,
but no one was hurt.</p>

<p>Then <a href="#image04">the savages</a>, with whoops and yells, <a href="#image04">began
circling about the machine.</a> Around and around
they went, riding their ponies at top speed. Suddenly,
as if in response to some signal, they withdrew
quite a distance, but still hemmed the travelers
in a circle.</p>

</div>

<p>“They’re up to some mischief,” said Nestor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shall we wing one or two just to show we have
bullets?”</p>

<p>“Not for the world,” replied Broswick. “Our
only hope is not to get them too riled. They may
draw off an’ leave us alone.”</p>

<p>But this was not the Indians’ intention. Once
more they began making a wide circle about the
auto.</p>

<p>“I see what the trouble was!” cried Jerry, looking
over from the tonneau to the front of the dashboard.
“The sparking plug was out. No wonder
we couldn’t start the machine.”</p>

<p>He reached over and put the small brass pin in
the proper socket.</p>

<p>“Now I’m going to have another try!” he called
to Broswick and Nestor. “Get ready to jump in
the machine!”</p>

<p>Before Nestor could stop him, Jerry had leaped
to the ground. He ran around to the front of the
auto, seized the cranking handle and gave several
vigorous turns. As he did so a chorus of savage
yells arose from the Indian ranks, and several more
shots were fired.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a><br />
<small>OVER A CLIFF.</small></h2>


<p>The bullets struck all around Jerry, but none of
them struck him. Some of the leaden missiles hit
the ground and made little clouds of dust, and
others zipped on all sides of the auto.</p>

<p>All at once the explosions of the auto motor
mingled with the banging of the Indians’ guns.
Jerry had started the engine.</p>

<p>“Get in!” he cried, leaping to the steering seat.</p>

<p>Broswick, Nestor and Professor Snodgrass
obeyed the command.</p>

<p>“What about my horse?” cried the hunter.</p>

<p>“Let him go! It’s you or the nag!” yelled the
miner.</p>

<p>In another instant the whole party was in the
auto and Jerry yanked the levers to full speed
ahead. Off the car shot, Jerry steering for an
opening in the circle of Indians.</p>

<p>With wild yells the redmen watched the auto
glide away. They fired shots at it, and one Indian
hit Broswick, but the wound was only a slight
one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here comes your horse!” shouted Bob, glancing
behind, and, sure enough, Broswick’s steed
was galloping after the swiftly moving auto as
though he was on the race track.</p>

<p>In a little while the adventurers left the Indians
behind and were at a safe distance from any bullets.
The hunter’s horse, too, kept running, and
got away.</p>

<p>“Well, we didn’t bargain for this when we left
home,” remarked Jerry, as he slowed up the machine
after an hour’s run.</p>

<p>“I should say not,” put in Bob. “Being attacked
by Indians was the last thing I ever thought
of.”</p>

<p>“You’re out in the wild an’ woolly West,” observed
Nestor. “You’ll see stranger things before
you get through.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see something to eat right now,”
came from Bob.</p>

<p>“There goes Chunky,” said Ned. “He’s always
as hungry as he was at home.”</p>

<p>In spite of poking fun at the stout youth, every
one felt the need of food. So a stop was made, a
fire built, and soon coffee was boiling. Broswick
went off in the woods with his rifle and came back
with a brace of birds and a jack rabbit. What the
boys voted was the finest meal they ever ate was
quickly prepared.</p>

<p>“We must be careful not to lose the auto again,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
said Jerry. “We have had trouble enough with
Noddy. The next time he may beat us altogether.”</p>

<p>When camp was made that night a system of
watches was arranged so that some one would be
on guard all through the dark hours.</p>

<p>Nothing disturbed the adventurers, however,
and in the morning they started again on their trip
across the mountains, which, it seemed, would
never come to an end.</p>

<p>Several days, including Sunday, passed without
incident. No very fast time was made, and the
machine had to be sent along carefully, as the roads
were bad and the trail was uncertain to them. One
morning Broswick announced that he was going
off on a hunt. Nestor and Professor Snodgrass
said they would go with him. Accordingly, the
hunter’s horse was tied near the auto and the three
men set off, while the three boys remained behind
to make some repairs to the machine and do a
little necessary overhauling.</p>

<p>“We’ll be back by dinner-time,” announced Broswick;
“that is, if something doesn’t happen to us.”</p>

<p>The boys were so busy that they scarcely noted
the passage of time. It was not until Jerry looked
at his watch and announced that it was two o’clock
that the lads wondered what had happened to their
friends.</p>

<p>“It’s long past meal time,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re not hungry,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“More likely they’re in trouble,” spoke Jerry, an
anxious look on his face. “I think we had better
hunt them up.”</p>

<p>This the boys decided to do, after getting themselves
a light lunch. They ran the auto along the
track the three men had taken, but after riding
half an hour found no sign of their friends.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’re on the wrong track,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Or else they didn’t come this way,” put in Ned.</p>

<p>They turned the machine around and rode back
slowly, looking for marks along the road.</p>

<p>“There’s something!” exclaimed Jerry. He
pointed to a small match-box lying on the ground.
“Nestor always carried that,” he said. “It must
have dropped from his pocket. The men have
been here.”</p>

<p>“Hark! What’s that?” cried Bob.</p>

<p>All listened. To their ears came a faint but unmistakable
cry.</p>

<p>“Help!”</p>

<p>“There they are!” called Jerry. “Over to the
left! We must hurry to them!”</p>

<p>He sent the machine ahead at a swift pace. The
road led along the top of a plateau and ran close
to the edge of a cliff. As the machine neared this
spot the cries became louder. Near the edge of the
precipice Jerry brought the machine to a stop.</p>

<p>“They are down there,” he announced, after listening
carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys dismounted from the car and approached
the ledge. It went down straight for
about fifty feet and then bulged out into a shelf
before making a sheer descent to the valley, three
hundred feet below.</p>

<p>Near the edge of the precipice the earth and
rocks were freshly torn away, showing that something
had gone over. Jerry got down on his
hands and knees and crept to the edge. What
he saw as he looked down made him spring to
his feet and shout in mingled fear and astonishment.</p>

<p>There, on a jutting spur of the mountain, hardly
large enough to hold them, were the three missing
men.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” Jerry called down.</p>

<p>“Bruised and scratched, but no bones broken,”
shouted Nestor. “You’ll have to haul us up some
way, for we can’t get down nor crawl up.”</p>

<p>“Git a rope!” shouted Broswick, “an’ lower it
down.”</p>

<p>“A rope! I don’t believe there’s one long enough
within ten miles of here!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is,” said Jerry, quickly. “We have
the one they tried to hang Professor Snodgrass
with&mdash;the same we used on the tree. It’s in the
auto. You get it, Bob.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes a long rope was dangling over
the edge of the cliff, and when the end reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
men imprisoned on the ledge they set up a joyful
shout. The boys retained their end and at a signal
from Nestor, who had tied the cable about the professor,
under his arms, Bob, Ned and Jerry began
to haul away. They strained and pulled, but the
man at the other end did not budge.</p>

<p>“It’s caught!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>Jerry ran forward, telling Ned and Bob to retain
their hold of the rope. He found that the
cord rasped against an edge of rock as it passed
up from the depths below, and this produced so
much friction that great force would have to be
used in pulling the men up. Then, too, there was
the danger of the rope fraying and being cut in
two.</p>

<p>Jerry thought over the problem a few seconds.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter up there?” asked Nestor.</p>

<p>“Never mind!” shouted back Jerry. “We’ll
have you up in a jiffy now.”</p>

<p>He hurried over to a little clump of trees and
came back with a short section of a round limb.</p>

<p>“This will be a roller for the rope to pass over,
just like a pulley,” he announced. Then he proceeded
to put his plan in operation. Lying down
on his face, he held the log in position, the rope
passing over it. Then he told Bob and Ned to
pull.</p>

<p>But even with this advantage there was trouble.
The two boys managed to get the professor up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
short distance, but they were not strong enough to
hoist him all the way.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” the naturalist cried, as he felt
himself dangling.</p>

<p>“This will not do!” exclaimed Jerry. “Let him
down easy, boys; I’ll have to think of another
plan.”</p>

<p>It began to look as though the rescue of the men
on the ledge was to be a harder task than at first
supposed. At Jerry’s direction, the end of the rope
the boys had was fastened to a stake driven into
the ground.</p>

<p>“Now I wonder what we’d better do?” mused
Jerry. “We’ll have to use the limb of the tree as
a roller, and some one has to hold it in place. Yet
it will take all three of us to pull one man up. If
only one of the men was up here to give a hand we
could manage. As it is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have it!” cried Ned, suddenly, and he ran
back to where the auto stood.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a><br />
<small>THE CHASE.</small></h2>


<p>Ned reached the machine, cranked it up, and a
few minutes later steered it close to where Bob and
Jerry stood.</p>

<p>“The auto can do what we can’t,” he said.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” came from Jerry.</p>

<p>“I mean it can pull the men up over the cliff!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! So it can!” exclaimed Jerry. “I see
your plan.”</p>

<p>The car was turned around so the rear of it was
close to the edge of the precipice. Then the rope
was fastened to the axle.</p>

<p>“Get ready, down below!” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“We’re ready!” came back the answer.</p>

<p>Jerry and Bob stretched out on the ground, each
one holding an end of the improvised roller. Ned
started the auto slowly. The rope strained and
tightened. Then, as the car gathered speed, the
cable was pulled up, and Professor Snodgrass, tied
to the other end, was hauled from his perilous
position.</p>

<p>As his head came into view over the edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
precipice, Jerry shouted to Ned to stop the car.
The next instant the naturalist was helped to solid
ground by the two boys. The plan had worked.</p>

<p>In quick succession Nestor and the hunter were
pulled up in the same fashion.</p>

<p>“Well, I must say you boys are smart chaps,”
spoke the miner. “Automobiles are useful critters
in more ways than to ride in.”</p>

<p>“How did you ever get down there?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“It was all my fault,” said Professor Snodgrass.
“We were walking along, and I saw a particularly
rare specimen of a little garter-snake. It was moving
through the grass and I raced after it. It went
over the edge of the cliff, and I reached down and
tried to get it. It was so far over that I had to lie
down flat on my face and stretch my arms.
Then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ when he found he couldn’t reach the
critter even then,” interrupted Broswick, “he
asked Nestor an’ me to hold his heels while he
stretched down. Blamed if I ever do such a thing
ag’in.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“’Cause jest as soon as me an’ Nestor got hold
of his heels an’ was easin’ him over the cliff, I’ll
be jiggered if the whole top didn’t give way an’
there we was, slidin’ down the mountain at about
forty miles a minute. I thought we was gone coons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
sure, but we struck on the ledge an’ that saved
us.”</p>

<p>“We’d been there yet if you boys hadn’t come
along,” said Nestor. “But say, I’m mighty
hungry.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t much to eat,” spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is,” came from the hunter. “I shot
some partridge jest afore we had that bloomin’ old
snake hunt.”</p>

<p>He walked over to where he had left his game
and came back with a double brace of fine birds. It
was not long before the partridges were roasting
over a fire and every one with a good appetite prepared
to eat.</p>

<p>“Where’s my specimen box?” suddenly exclaimed
the professor, after an inspection of the
auto. “It’s gone!”</p>

<p>“No; I just laid it to one side when I wanted to
use the machine to haul you up with,” explained
Ned. “It is safe. But what do you want of it
now?”</p>

<p>“To put my snake in, of course,” and the scientist
showed a tiny serpent grasped in his hand.</p>

<p>“So you got it after all, eh?” asked Broswick.
“I thought you missed it when them rocks an’ dirt
slid an’ let us all down kersmash over the cliff.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have lost that snake for ten thousand
dollars,” said the professor, as he put it safely
away with his other curiosities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>After dinner the journey toward the lost gold
mine was again taken up. In a short time the auto
and its occupants, as well as Broswick on his horse,
were making good speed. Presently it was noticed
that the road was sloping downward. Jerry remarked
on the fact.</p>

<p>“We’ve crossed the divide,” announced Nestor.
“From now on, until we get to the mine, we’ll be
going downhill. There’s another rise of the mountains
after we pass the mine, though.”</p>

<p>It was now about five o’clock, and as the adventurers
had eaten dinner rather late they decided not
to stop for supper, but to keep on until it was time
to camp for the night and have another meal
then.</p>

<p>When it got too dark to go any further on the
road, even though the gas and oil lamps gave a
glaring light, a halt was made. Supper was eaten
and soon all but Broswick, who mounted first
guard, was slumbering.</p>

<p>Next morning the travelers came to a long, level
stretch, on top of a vast plateau, and here good
speed could be made. Jerry was steering the car,
his turn having come around, and Broswick’s horse
was keeping up well, for the boys would not leave
the hunter behind, and regulated their pace to that
of his steed.</p>

<p>As they went around a curve and came to a
straight stretch, Jerry cried out and pointed ahead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
They all looked, to behold another automobile
speeding away from them.</p>

<p>“That’s Noddy’s car, I’m sure of it!” Jerry
shouted. “I’d know it anywhere by this time.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to catch those rascals!” exclaimed Nestor.
“They’ve made trouble enough for us, an’
they’ll make more if they can. Besides, I have my
score to settle with that chap Pender. I’d have
overlooked it if they’d let us alone, but now I want
to git even!”</p>

<p>“There’s no reason why you shouldn’t,” said
Broswick. “Your machine is as good as theirs.
Give ’em a chase. If you catch ’em, put their auto
out of business until you have enough of
a start to get to the mine first. Besides,
we could have the law on ’em for stealin’ this
machine.”</p>

<p>“But what about leaving you behind?” questioned
Jerry, to whom the thought of a chase after
his old enemies was not unwelcome.</p>

<p>“Leave me behind; I’ll catch up to you later,”
spoke the hunter.</p>

<p>Jerry looked at Nestor. The miner nodded his
head in approval. The next instant the auto
fairly sprang forward, as Jerry threw on
the high-speed gear and opened wide the
flow of gasolene.</p>

<p>The chase was on. Jerry sent out a challenging
“honk” on the horn, and it was answered by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
auto ahead. That machine, too, as soon as the
occupants became aware of the pursuit, went forward
at top speed.</p>

<p>Fortunately for all, the road was much better
than the average. It was wide and level, and as
soon as the machines had warmed up they fairly
flew along.</p>

<p>“Aren’t&mdash;we go-going a&mdash;a&mdash;trifle fast?” asked
Professor Snodgrass, in a frightened tone, as he
held fast to the car-side to avoid being bounced
out.</p>

<p>“That’s the intention,” said Nestor. “The other
fellows are doin’ it an’ we have to do likewise.
Hold tight!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the auto went over a rock and every
one was tossed from his seat, to fall back with a
jarring bump.</p>

<p>The pace was now very fast. With straining
eyes Jerry watched his rivals in front. Slowly but
surely he could see that the distance between them
was lessening. Once or twice some one in the forward
car looked back to note the progress of the
chase.</p>

<p>“We’ll catch them!” yelled Ned.</p>

<p>Faster and faster went the auto. The trees and
rocks seemed to shoot past. The distance between
the two machines was constantly lessening until
now it was but a quarter of a mile.</p>

<p>“They may use guns,” ventured Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“I reckon they will, son,” replied Nestor, “but
if they try that game they’ll find we can shoot a
bit ourselves.”</p>

<p>He got out his brace of revolvers and saw to it
that they were loaded.</p>

<p>“Not that I’m anxious to hurt any one,” the
miner went on, “but we must protect our lives and
our machine.”</p>

<p>Soon but an eighth of a mile separated the pursued
and pursuing forces. The occupants of the
other car could be plainly seen, and Ned, who was
riding beside Jerry, noticed Jack Pender stand up
in the rear seat and shake his fist.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t do that if we were a little closer,”
observed Ned.</p>

<p>Jerry now saw victory before him. He prepared
to run to one side ahead of Noddy’s machine and so
block its further progress.</p>

<p>He was about to press the accelerating lever to
give his car a momentary burst of speed when there
suddenly sounded a great roaring. It seemed to
come from the side of a small mountain along the
base of which the plateau road now ran.</p>

<p>Then the air seemed to fill with dust. The very
earth trembled and all at once a section of the
mountain slipped down right on top of the pursuing
auto, fairly overwhelming it.</p>

<p>It was a big landslide, and it had come just in
time to catch Jerry and his friends and let the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
machine escape, for the auto Noddy and his gang
were in got out of the way of the rush of rocks and
earth.</p>

<p>There was a resounding crash. Then all seemed
to become black to Jerry.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a><br />
<small>WRECKED.</small></h2>


<p>When Jerry recovered consciousness he found
himself sitting on the ground, while Ned and Nestor
were bathing his head with water that Professor
Snodgrass was bringing up in his hat.</p>

<p>“Where am I? What happened?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“You’re still on the map,” said the miner, “and
as for what happened, it was what often happens
out here. Part of the mountain parted company
from the main hill, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Is the auto smashed?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“It appears to be damaged some,” replied the
miner, and Jerry felt his heart sink. “But never
mind that. It’s lucky we’re not all killed. You
were struck on the head by a stone and knocked
unconscious. The rest of us were just spilled out
when the machine turned over. But how do you
feel?”</p>

<p>“I’m all right, only a little weak,” replied the
boy. He stood up, and, aside from a little dizziness,
he found himself in good shape. His head
ached from the blow and was cut slightly, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
was too anxious about the machine to mind his
hurts.</p>

<p>With legs that trembled somewhat, he made his
way to where the auto had overturned from the
force of the landslide. The machine presented
a sorry sight. The baggage was spilled out and
things were scattered all about. There was a break
in the water tank and the fluid had run out. The
steering-post was also bent, and one chain was
broken. What other damage was done could not
be seen until some of the dirt was removed.</p>

<p>“I wish Broswick would come along with his
spade,” said Nestor. “We need him.”</p>

<p>“There he comes now,” spoke up Ned, pointing
back on the road they had come. At the top of a
gentle slope a figure on horseback could be
made out. The man waved his hand. It was
the hunter, and in a short time he came up to the
wreck.</p>

<p>“Waal,” he remarked, “looks like ye had
trouble.”</p>

<p>“We did,” replied Nestor, and he told of the
landslide. “But,” he went on, “I reckon these boys
know how to git us out of it. I’ll stake my last
dollar on these boys,” and he smiled in a way that
made the down-hearted lads feel better.</p>

<p>Broswick’s spade did good service, and soon the
machine was cleared of the dirt sufficiently to allow
of its being righted. Then Jerry made a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
careful examination. As he went around on the
right side of it he uttered a despairing cry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“The battery box is gone!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“It was carried away in the landslide, and we
haven’t another cell. We’re stranded, sure
enough.”</p>

<p>He pointed to where, on the right step, a small,
square box had rested. In this box were the dry
batteries that supplied the spark.</p>

<p>Without the vital spark the auto could not advance
a foot, and, as Jerry had said, the last of
the spare batteries had been used and no new ones
procured. The adventurers were certainly in dire
straits.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can find the batteries somewhere in
the dirt,” suggested Nestor.</p>

<p>Acting on this idea, the boys and men made a
careful search among the rocks and gravel that
covered the road. They found the battery box,
but it was splintered to pieces and not a single cell
could be located. They went over every inch of
the debris with no better result.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon we’re booked for a stay at this
summer resort,” said Nestor, with forced cheerfulness.</p>

<p>“It will be a good chance for me to get some
specimens,” said the naturalist, as if nothing mattered
so long as he got some bugs or snakes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“I reckon you’ll have all the time you want,” put
in the hunter. “But speakin’ of specimens reminds
me that I’m hungry. I think I’ll take my
gun an’ see if I can’t pot somethin’ for dinner.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to eat if we can’t travel,” observed
Nestor. “Supposin’, Bob, you an’ Ned make a
fire, while Jerry tinkers over the auto. Perhaps
he can make it go, after all. We’ve had good
luck so far, all but this.”</p>

<p>Jerry shook his head. He knew that without
the batteries the machine could not be operated.
It was like trying to run an engine without a fire
under the boiler.</p>

<p>However, he set to work to repair what damage
he could. With a small soldering outfit he mended
the hole in the water tank, stopping the leak. Then,
with an extra link, of which several were carried,
the broken chain was mended.</p>

<p>By this time Broswick came back with some
partridges and rabbits and a meal, though it lacked
many extras, was soon in preparation. After eating,
Jerry went back to the machine. He took out
the steering-post, and, with the help of Nestor,
straightened it. Then some other small repairs
were made, and, though the auto looked rather
battered and battle-scarred, the paint being
scratched in many places, it was still serviceable.
All that was lacking was the battery box.</p>

<p>Jerry even filled the water tank from a nearby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
spring, and then, not being able to do anything
more, sat down on a stone and contemplated the
useless auto, with sad eyes.</p>

<p>“No use cryin’ over spilt milk,” said Nestor,
with rude philosophy. “What can’t be cured must
be endured. It’s a long lane that has no turns, an’
the longest way ’round is the shortest way home.”</p>

<p>“Git a hoss! Git a hoss!” exclaimed Broswick,
suddenly.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” asked Nestor.
“Gone crazy or are you gittin’ your second childhood?”</p>

<p>“Git a hoss!” repeated the hunter, capering
about like a schoolboy.</p>

<p>“What ails you?” demanded Nestor.</p>

<p>“Ain’t that what the kids cry when they see a
busted auto?” asked the hunter. “Seems to me I’ve
read that in the funny papers. Am I right?”</p>

<p>“You be,” said Nestor. “But what’s the use of
rubbin’ our misfortune in?” he grumbled.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Then what made you yell ‘Git a horse’?”</p>

<p>“’Cause that jest’s what you’re goin’ to do!”</p>

<p>“Say, did you sleep in the moonlight last night,
’cause you must have, an’ gone looney!” exclaimed
Nestor. “You&mdash;&mdash;” and then he stopped suddenly,
as he caught the hunter’s idea. “Well, I’ll
be ding-busted!” he finished, weakly.</p>

<p>“That’s jest what you’re goin’ to do,” went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the miner. “My Kate is as strong a hoss as you’d
want. We’re goin’ downhill most of the way,
anyhow, an’ it’ll be easy for Kate to pull the machine
an’ us in it. There’s a town about fifty
miles ahead, an’ maybe you can git some of them
batter-cakes there.”</p>

<p>“Batter-cakes?” repeated Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes. Ain’t them what you want?”</p>

<p>“Batteries&mdash;dry electric batteries,” said Jerry,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Waal, that’s what I meant, only I spelled it
wrong. They keep minin’ supplies in this town,
and they’ll be sure to have batteries. Kate can
pull us that far if we go slow.”</p>

<p>Broswick’s suggestion was voted a good one.
The spirits of all were raised, and soon the hunter
and Nestor busied themselves making a rude sort
of rope harness for the horse.</p>

<p>The animal did not seem to mind pulling the
auto, and, after everything had been collected, and
some of the game the hunter had shot was packed
to be taken along for supper at the next stopping
place, the start was made.</p>

<p>It was slow traveling, compared to the former
speed, but it was sure. The slight down-grade
helped the animal dragging the heavy machine,
which otherwise would have proved too much for
one horse. The adventurers rode in the car, and
Ned steered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>It was decided there would be no night traveling
now, for they wanted to spare the horse as much
as possible, and there was too much danger with
the uncertain method of locomotion. So, when it
grew dusk, camp was made and a fire built. Supper
over, the travelers discussed the events of the
day until, one by one, they fell asleep, after posting
Ned as guard.</p>

<p>The boy took up his position in the shadow of a
big tree where he could watch the auto and observe
any one approaching within the circle of firelight.
He was sleepy, but he fought off the drowsiness.
Again and again his head would nod and
he would just catch himself falling off into a doze.</p>

<p>“Come, this will never do,” he said, shaking
himself wide awake. “I must get a drink of
water. Maybe that will make me feel more
lively.”</p>

<p>He walked over to where a pail of the liquid
had been placed and took a long draught. As he
was walking back to his place he started as he
saw a bright shaft of light glaring through the
trees about half a mile off to the left.</p>

<p>“That looked like a searchlight,” whispered the
boy. The next instant the unmistakable chug-chug
of an automobile could be heard.</p>

<p>“If that’s an auto, maybe we can get some batteries,”
thought Ned.</p>

<p>He hurried back to the camp-fire and awoke
Jerry.</p>

<p>“There’s an auto coming!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Jerry, at once alive to the
situation, and thinking of the batteries, just as
Ned had.</p>

<p>The two boys listened. The chugging of the
motor had ceased, but the searchlight was still
playing over the trees.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re wrecked, too,” spoke Ned.
“Let’s go over and see what it is.”</p>

<p>“Better tell Nestor,” suggested Jerry.</p>

<p>They woke up the miner and told him what they
had seen and heard.</p>

<p>“Go slow,” he cautioned. “Here, I’ll tell you
what to do. Jerry and I will take a look. No use
runnin’ into danger. It may be Noddy Nixon an’
his gang, an’ if it is, we’ve got to be careful.”</p>

<p>Neither of the boys had thought of this. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
they realized the force of it. Bidding Ned
to be on guard, Nestor set out, accompanied by
Jerry. The miner had his revolvers ready and
Jerry carried the hunter’s gun. They did not intend
to shoot to kill or injure any one, but thought
the weapons would be useful in an emergency to
scare off the enemy, if they should happen to meet
one.</p>

<p>With great caution they moved in the direction
from which the sounds had come. The white, glaring
light was now stationary, and, like a giant finger,
was pointing up toward the sky. It served as
a guiding star for Jerry and Nestor.</p>

<p>“Let me go ahead,” suggested the miner, when
they had come quite close to where the light had its
source.</p>

<p>Taking the advance, Nestor made his way
through the underbrush and trees with great quietness.
Jerry followed as best he could. Suddenly
the miner stopped.</p>

<p>“I see them!” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Who are they?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to play a trick,” said Nestor, without
answering the boy. “Here, you go over there
to the right, about five hundred feet, and fire your
gun. Leave the rest to me, and as soon as you’ve
pulled the trigger hurry back to our camp.”</p>

<p>Jerry did not question the advice. He turned to
the right, and, when he had gone what he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
was the required distance, he discharged his revolver.
A loud report crashed out on the silence
of the night. Jerry heard a crackling of underbrush
and several shouts. Then, as Nestor had
told him, he made the best of his way back to camp.</p>

<p>As for the miner, he had remained where he
was when Jerry left him. He was watching the
other automobile, and something seemed to strike
him as funny, for he chuckled silently.</p>

<p>“I reckon there’s goin’ to be some surprises here
pretty soon,” he remarked.</p>

<p>At the report of Jerry’s gun, those about the
automobile rushed off in the direction of the shot.
At the same time Nestor, who was waiting for just
this very move, ran in. He fumbled about the machine
for a few minutes and then, clasping something
tightly in his arms, hurried back through the
woods to the camp, reaching there shortly after
Jerry.</p>

<p>Those who had been left sleeping were aroused
by the gun, and they were anxious to know what
the matter was. Ned told his part and then Jerry
related what had befallen him and Nestor.</p>

<p>“But what have you there?” asked Broswick of
the miner, observing that Nestor carried something.</p>

<p>“A box of batteries,” was the reply. “I took
them off the other automobile. Now we can go
ahead under our own power.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what&mdash;why&mdash;how?” began Jerry, with a
puzzled look.</p>

<p>“I’ll explain it all,” said Nestor; “but, first,
hadn’t you better fix these batteries on our machine?
We may want to start soon.”</p>

<p>It did not take long for Jerry to make the necessary
connections. Then, with the Cresville auto
again in shape for flight, Nestor told his story.</p>

<p>“Who do you think the crowd in charge of the
other auto was?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Give it up,” exclaimed Bob, the quicker to find
out.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon and his gang! As soon as I saw
through the trees I made up my mind it was better
to use cunning than force. I happened to see on
their auto the same kind of a box that was taken
off ours by the landslide. I figured that they had
made so much trouble for us, the least thing they
could do would be to lend us their batteries. So I
jest reckoned I’d borrow ’em.</p>

<p>“I sent Jerry off to one side to fire a gun and
draw their attention there. I knew they’d run
when they heard the noise. They did, and I
sailed in and yanked off the batteries. There they
be.”</p>

<p>Nestor seemed quite proud of his work. The
boys were very glad to have their auto in shape
again, and it was felt that Noddy and his crowd
got no more than they deserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“They may trace us and make trouble,” suggested
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I reckon they’ll have hard enough work in the
dark,” said Nestor. “But perhaps we’d better
move on, an’ git a good start of ’em. They may
have extra batteries an’ set out to chase us.”</p>

<p>So, breaking camp, though it was still dark, the
adventurers went forward once more, Broswick riding
on his horse, that, no doubt, was glad to be relieved
of the task of pulling the auto. The machine
worked well, the batteries transferred from
Noddy’s auto doing good service.</p>

<p>It was daybreak before the travelers halted, and
by this time they were well beyond where Noddy
and his companions had camped.</p>

<p>“Here’s a good place to stop,” said Nestor, indicating
a little clearing near a mountain stream.
“We ought to get breakfast now.”</p>

<p>For several days after this the trip went on without
incident. The weather continued fairly good,
with only an occasional rainstorm. The adventurers
heard of the big rush of gold seekers to the
district where Nestor’s mine was located; but so
far, they were ahead of the big crowd they had
seen some time before.</p>

<p>“We’ll git there fust, after all,” said Broswick,
as he sat astride his horse, that was now getting
rather bony and thin from the long journey.</p>

<p>“No tellin’,” rejoined Nestor. “There’s a lot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of miners in this region, an’ if they git to that mine
ahead of us there’s goin’ to be trouble.”</p>

<p>One afternoon, following a good day’s run, the
auto came to the end of the long mountain slope
down which the adventurers had been riding for
so long. They were now on a vast plain, or rather
level valley, lying between two of the big mountain
ranges. It was a pleasant country to travel in, and
every one felt in good spirits.</p>

<p>“We’re gittin’ near to the place,” said Nestor,
on reaching the level stretch. “We’ll keep on due
west for a little while. I’ve sort of lost my bearin’s,
but I’ll git ’em back in a little while.”</p>

<p>He seemed somewhat worried, and was continually
peering first to one side, then the other.</p>

<p>For several miles the auto journeyed on. No
sign of human life was seen, though there were
plenty of small animals and insects that Professor
Snodgrass wanted to gather. But Nestor would
hear of no delay.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried the miner, suddenly, as the
auto passed a sort of trail leading up the valley.
“This looks as if I’d seen it before.”</p>

<p>Jerry brought the machine to a stop, and Nestor
got out. He looked at the trees on either side of
the trail and then came running back to the machine.</p>

<p>“It’s all right!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What is?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ve found the lost trail to the mine,” replied
Nestor. “I didn’t think I’d strike it this way, but
we have. Forward! Now for the richest gold
mine in the Rockies!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted the boys, and Professor
Snodgrass and the hunter joined in the cheers.</p>

<p>“Leave your horse here, Broswick,” advised
Nestor. “He’ll be safe and the trail ahead is a
hard one on animals. Get in the auto with us.”</p>

<p>The hunter agreed to the plan, and his faithful
steed was turned loose where there was plenty of
food and water. Then, with the six in the auto,
though they were rather crowded, the machine was
started off toward the long-sought mine.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from down the valley, sounded the
noise of another machine approaching. Ned turned
around.</p>

<p>“Here comes Noddy Nixon!” he shouted.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a><br />
<small>A RACE TO THE MINE.</small></h2>


<p>Before long Noddy Nixon and his crowd in
their auto shot up alongside the Motor Boys and
their friends. Noddy looked over and grinned,
while Pud Stoneham raised his hat in mocking politeness.</p>

<p>“Hurry up!” said Nestor to Jerry, in a low
voice. “They are going to give us a race to the
mine. We must get there first!”</p>

<p>“What difference does it make?” asked the boy,
as he speeded up his machine.</p>

<p>“All the difference in the world,” replied the
miner. “I’ve staked my claim, but I haven’t filed
the papers in the Government office, as the law requires.
The first man who comes along could jump
my claim now. I was relyin’ on the mine bein’
hard to find, but I see it has been discovered. We
must beat them!”</p>

<p>“We’ll do it if possible,” said Jerry, with determination
in his voice. “I wonder how they got
in shape so quickly after we took their batteries?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Probably had another set,” was Nestor’s opinion.</p>

<p>The two machines were now moving almost side
by side, up the defile which led to the mine. The
autos were about two hundred feet apart and going
at about the same rate of speed, which was not very
fast, as the road was not of the best.</p>

<p>“How are you?” called out Jack Pender.</p>

<p>“None the better for seeing you,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“Thought you was smart to take our batteries,
didn’t you?” went on Pender. “Well, we’ll show
you a trick or two. We’ll get to that mine before
you!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got another guess comin’, young man!”
cried Nestor. “When I git through with you there
won’t be enough left to fill a hollow tooth. I’ve
got a score to settle with you.”</p>

<p>At this, Jack sank back in his seat. Bill Berry,
who had been eyeing the Motor Boys, shouted out:</p>

<p>“If you cubs are lookin’ fer trouble there’ll be
plenty of it. We’re not in Cresville now, where all
your friends are.”</p>

<p>“I’m a born trouble-hunter!” exclaimed Hank
Broswick, rising in his seat and carelessly leveling
his rifle at the wheels of Noddy’s auto. “I kin hit
trouble a mile off!”</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot!” yelled Noddy, trying to duck
behind the dash-board and steer at the same time,
with the result that he nearly overturned the auto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wasn’t goin’ to,” replied the hunter, with a
grim chuckle. “I only wanted to let you know I
was on hand in case I might be wanted.”</p>

<p>After this the taunts from Noddy’s gang ceased.
In stern determination the race now settled down
into a contest to see who should be first at the mine,
for on that depended everything.</p>

<p><a href="#image01">For nearly ten miles the two autos were close
together</a>, neither gaining any advantage. It began
to get dusk, and the boys considered whether they
should stop for the night or keep on.</p>

<p>“I think we had better camp until morning,” advised
Broswick. “We might git ahead of ’em, an’,
again, we might not. The chances are we’d bust a
tire or sumthin’, an’ then we’d be worse off than
before. Slow an’ sure is better than quick an’
never.”</p>

<p>So, somewhat to Nestor’s disappointment, the
auto came to a stop when the road was no longer
visible because of darkness.</p>

<p>“They’re goin’ on; I don’t see why we can’t,”
grumbled the miner.</p>

<p>“Too risky,” replied Broswick. “We’ll make
better time in the end.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ve got to start bright an’ early in the
mornin’,” stipulated Nestor.</p>

<p>To this they all agreed. Supper was prepared
and the guard set. The other auto, with a last
mocking toot of the horn, had disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>When the first indication of light in the east told
that dawn was at hand, Broswick, who had the last
watch, awoke his companions. A hasty breakfast
was made and, even before the sun was up, the
journey was renewed.</p>

<p>“I’d feel easier if I could git a sight of them
other fellers,” said Nestor.</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose they kept on goin’ all night?”
asked Broswick.</p>

<p>“Let’s see if we can’t pick up their trail,” suggested
Professor Snodgrass. “We can easily tell
if an auto has preceded us.”</p>

<p>Jerry stopped the machine and Broswick got out.
He made a careful examination of the road and
soon gave a yell that told he had discovered something.</p>

<p>“They’re ahead,” he announced, “but they made
a stop here. The ground is all trampled up. I
wouldn’t wonder if they had a breakdown, an’ had
to halt for fixin’ their shebang up. They can’t be
very far in advance.”</p>

<p>With lighter hearts the adventurers started off
once more, keeping a sharp lookout for the other
auto. The sun rose high in the heavens, and it
was hot in the valley. Mile after mile was reeled
off, but Noddy’s machine was not in view.</p>

<p>It was almost noon when Professor Snodgrass,
who was peering intently ahead, suddenly uttered
a cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I thought I saw a specimen of the almost extinct
herds of buffalo,” answered the naturalist.</p>

<p>“Buffalo!” cried Nestor, standing up to get
a good view. “That’s the other automobile you
see!”</p>

<p>“So it is!” admitted the professor, taking a
second glance.</p>

<p>“Put on all the steam you’ve got!” cried the
miner. “We must catch them before night or the
mine is lost! We’re close to it now!”</p>

<p>Jerry opened the throttle wide and shortened
the intervals of sparking. The automobile fairly
jumped ahead, but so rough was the road that
the travelers were bounced about like peas in a
pod.</p>

<p>“We’re gaining on them!” Ned shouted. “We’ll
soon be up to them!”</p>

<p>In a little while not more than an eighth of a
mile separated the two machines, and this distance
was gradually being lessened. Stoneham and Dalsett,
who were in the rear seat, looked back and
shook their fists.</p>

<p>“Not very pleasant chaps,” commented Nestor.
“Well, we don’t mind how they look.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later the autos were even, racing
along the valley toward the coveted riches. The
excitement of the race was too keen to admit of
the wasting of breath in useless taunts. A tense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
silence was preserved, broken only by the throbbing
of the rival motors.</p>

<p>“Have we any water aboard?” asked Bob, about
ten minutes after the two machines got on even
terms.</p>

<p>“I guess there’s plenty in the tanks,” answered
Ned.</p>

<p>“I mean to drink,” went on Chunky. “I’m as dry
as a fish.”</p>

<p>“Now that you speak of it, I would like a cool
cupful myself,” admitted Ned. “Have we any,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Not a drop.”</p>

<p>The subject was not mentioned again for some
time. But once the idea had been broached it
seemed impossible for Bob or Ned to get rid of it.
Their thirst grew amazingly under the hot sun,
and soon all the others were thinking how delicious
some cold water would be.</p>

<p>“I’ve simply got to have a drink,” said poor Bob
at length. “I’ll die if I don’t get one.”</p>

<p>He certainly looked as if he needed it. The
others, too, were suffering the torments of thirst,
for they had drunk nothing since early morning.</p>

<p>“Can’t we stop and get some water?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“If we do we’ll lose several minutes,” said Nestor,
“and seconds will count now. Try and stand
it a little longer. Make believe you are shipwrecked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and can’t get a drink. Sometimes sailors
go for days without a drink.”</p>

<p>“But they couldn’t get it if they wanted to,”
spoke Bob, “and as for us, there’s a spring right
alongside of the road,” and he pointed to one
ahead.</p>

<p>Jerry was about to turn up to it and stop, but
Nestor urged him to keep the auto going.</p>

<p>“We don’t want to lose everything, when we’re
jest about succeedin’, all fer a little water,” he
said. “Three hours more will see us at the mine.
If we stop now they’ll beat us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give my share in the mine for a good
drink,” wailed Bob.</p>

<p>“So will I!” chimed in Ned.</p>

<p>In truth, the boys were suffering severely. So
were the men, but they were used to hardships, and
the thought of the gold ahead made them indifferent
to the wants of the body.</p>

<p>“See, we’re coming to a river,” went on Ned,
pointing to where a bridge could be seen spanning
a stream. “We can get water there.”</p>

<p>“And lose the gold mine!” exclaimed Nestor,
fiercely. “No, sir! We don’t stop until we’re on
the ground. Then you can get all the water you
want.”</p>

<p>He seemed so excited that the boys were somewhat
afraid of him, though they knew it was all
due to the strain of the moment. To add to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
discomfiture, they could see the other gold seekers
in their auto taking copious drinks from bottles of
water.</p>

<p>“My throat is all parched up!” cried Bob. “I
must have water!”</p>

<p>“So you shall!” shouted Jerry.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a><br />
<small>GOLD!</small></h2>


<p>“Do you mean to stop the car and let them git
ahead of us?” demanded Nestor.</p>

<p>“I’m going to stop the car,” replied Jerry, “but
they’re not going to get ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“How you goin’ to prevent it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you. Wait until we get to the bridge.”</p>

<p>The two machines were close together and the
bridge was now about an eighth of a mile ahead.
Suddenly Jerry shifted the lever to throw the third
gear into place, at the same time opening the
throttle. The red auto fairly sprang forward,
leaving the other behind.</p>

<p>At first, Noddy, who was steering his machine,
was too surprised at Jerry’s move to know what
to do. When he did attempt to speed up, the other
car was several hundred feet in advance. Two
minutes later Jerry had reached the bridge and
brought his auto to a stop.</p>

<p>“There!” he exclaimed. “I guess we can hold
them here as long as we like. The other car can’t
beat us, can it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should say not,” answered Nestor. “You’re
a slick one, Jerry!”</p>

<p>For the bridge was so narrow that there was but
room on it for one auto at a time. With Noddy’s
car in the rear, it could not go ahead until Jerry
was ready.</p>

<p>“We’ll all have a drink!” exclaimed Broswick.
“I’m as dry as a powder-horn myself.”</p>

<p>There was a general rush to the stream, which
proved to be a clear, cold, mountain brook, and
never did liquid taste better than that to the thirsty
adventurers. They had not half enough when
Noddy’s machine came puffing up, but was forced
to stop.</p>

<p>“Pull your machine out of there or I’ll ram
you!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess not!” said Nestor, slowly. “This
is a public road.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you whether it is or not,” went on
the bully, in a blustering tone, reaching for the
lever to send his car ahead. His intention was to
push the other auto off the bridge.</p>

<p>“Not so fast,” spoke Nestor, slowly, carelessly
drawing his revolver from the holster. “Those
are very pretty tires of yours, but it’s no fun ridin’
on ’em when the wind is out. So go easy, Mr.
Noddy Nixon!”</p>

<p>“We’ll fix you for this!” cried Dalsett.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it?” asked Nestor, in seeming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
surprise. “Well, I wouldn’t crow too soon if I
was you. It might not be altogether healthy, you
know.”</p>

<p>The other remained silent. The boys finished
drinking, and, at Broswick’s suggestion, filled several
cans with water, and placed them in the auto.</p>

<p>“Come, are you going to stay there all day?”
growled Noddy.</p>

<p>“As long as we please,” answered Nestor. “We
know what you’re up to, but we’ll beat you yet.”</p>

<p>“The mine belongs to whoever stakes it first,”
put in Dalsett.</p>

<p>“I see you know the law right enough,” spoke
Nestor. “But I wouldn’t advise you to get too
well acquainted with it. There are some little matters
in New Mexico the law might want you to explain,”
and he smiled at his former helper, whereat
Dalsett turned pale and muttered beneath his
breath.</p>

<p>But, having satisfied their thirst, the adventurers
had no longer any motive for blockading the
bridge. They started off, Jerry getting the motor
up to a good speed before throwing in the gear,
so that the car moved off swiftly at the start.</p>

<p>Like a flash, Noddy was after them. Once more
the race was on. The sun reached the zenith and
began to decline in the west.</p>

<p>Nestor was greatly excited. He was on familiar
ground now, and saw landmarks on every side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
As the auto passed a dead sycamore tree he
shouted:</p>

<p>“Only two miles farther now! Then, hurrah
for the gold!”</p>

<p>The other machine clung doggedly to the Cresville
auto. Jerry was going as fast as he dared,
and Noddy was close behind. A few minutes more
would tell the tale.</p>

<p>“One mile farther!” shouted Nestor.</p>

<p>The next instant there came a report like a revolver
shot. Every one started, thinking they had
been fired at.</p>

<p>“They’ve busted a tire!” shouted Broswick. “I
reckon that puts them out of the race!”</p>

<p>Noddy was obliged to bring his machine to a
sudden stop. There was a scene of confusion as
the crippled machine was forced to give up the
pursuit. Berry and Dalsett seemed to be urging
Noddy to continue in spite of the accident, but,
rash as the bully was, he knew better than to go on
with a collapsed tire.</p>

<p>Jerry never slackened the speed of his auto, and
rushed on, intent on the goal that was now so near.
Ten minutes later the road came to an abrupt end
against a slope of the mountain.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Jerry, throwing out the gear and
leaving the auto with the motor still running,
panting like one who has run a long race. “What
next? We can’t go any farther.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“We don’t need to,” replied Nestor.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“We’re at the mine. It’s on top of that hill,”
and Nestor indicated a little knob that rose about
two hundred feet away. “Come on, we’ll take a
look at it.”</p>

<p>Jerry shut off the power and, leaving Professor
Snodgrass in charge of the machine, the others
climbed up to the mouth of the shaft of the
long-lost mine that Nestor had so luckily discovered.</p>

<p>A rude ladder led down into the depths below.
Lighting some candles he had with him, Nestor descended,
telling the others to come, but to use caution,
as the ladders were old and rotten.</p>

<p>With hearts that beat high in hope, the boys
went down into the mine. The first level was about
fifty feet under the surface. Coming to a halt,
Nestor lit several more tallow ends.</p>

<p>“Look!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The boys stared in wonder. Gold, gold, gold
seemed to be on every side of them. It cropped
out in the dirt and rocks; big yellow veins that
glowed with a dull gleam in the flickering lights.
The sides of the mine were traversed with the
streaks of precious metal. Most of it was very
pure, and it could be dug out with a knife.</p>

<p>“It’s the richest mine I ever saw or heard of,”
said Nestor. “There’s enough gold in sight to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
make us all rich, even if no more develops as we
dig farther down. It’s a great strike!”</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” agreed Jerry. “But can we establish
a claim to it?”</p>

<p>“The mine will stand in our joint names before
another day,” replied Nestor. “I’ll start for the
Government office the first thing in the morning,
after I’ve staked a claim for each of us.”</p>

<p>“Providin’ Noddy Nixon an’ his crowd don’t
make more trouble,” spoke Broswick.</p>

<p>“They’re broke down,” answered Nestor.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ to prevent ’em from walkin’ here,”
went on the hunter. “Howsomever, if they come
we’ll be ready for ’em. Now let’s git supper.”</p>

<p>Taking a last look for the day at the riches
around them, the adventurers climbed to the surface.
They went to where they had left the automobile,
made a fire and were soon preparing a simple
meal. Broswick’s ready gun provided enough
for supper and also insured a feast of rabbit and
partridge for the next day.</p>

<p>The adventurers were so filled with thoughts of
their success at reaching the mine first that they
sat around the camp-fire until almost midnight,
going over the happenings that had befallen them
on their journey. Then, the first watch having
been assigned to Nestor, all the others sought their
blankets, and stretched out on the ground to sleep.</p>

<p>The hours of the night passed without incident.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
There were no sounds save, now and then, mournful
hootings of the owls and the bark of foxes.
Jerry had the last watch, from three until six
o’clock.</p>

<p>He was sleepy when Broswick aroused him to
take his place, but soon was wide awake enough.</p>

<p>“Anything happened?” he asked the hunter.</p>

<p>“No; but keep your eyes open. We have to deal
with a hard crowd, especially Dalsett. If you hear
any one approaching, fire in the air first and then
challenge.”</p>

<p>Jerry took up his vigil. To keep himself awake
he walked back and forth out of range of the light
from the camp-fire. Once or twice he thought he
heard sounds as of some one approaching, and he
nerved himself for a struggle.</p>

<p>But each time it proved to be only timid foxes
that, with startled eyes, came to see who had invaded
their woods and glens.</p>

<p>Just as dawn was about to herald itself by a pale
light in the east, Jerry heard a sound as of some
heavy body coming through the underbrush. He
was on the alert in a moment. Peering forward, he
saw the dim outlines of a man approaching between
the trees. The next instant Jerry fired in the air,
and called out:</p>

<p>“Who goes there?”</p>

<p>The reply was a volley of shots.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a><br />
<small>BESIEGED AT THE MINE.</small></h2>


<p>In an instant every one at the gold camp was on
his feet. Broswick reached for his ever-ready rifle
and Nestor had his revolvers out in a jiffy.</p>

<p>“What is it?” called the miner to Jerry.</p>

<p>“I heard some one coming, and I fired,” replied
the boy.</p>

<p>“Did you see any one?”</p>

<p>“I thought I saw a man, but I’m not sure.”</p>

<p>“You’re right! It was a man, and that man is
on deck now!” replied a mocking voice, but no one
was in sight.</p>

<p>“That’s Dalsett!” cried Nestor. “I know his
voice. Come out where I can see you, Dalsett!”
went on the miner. “But I s’pose you’re afraid to
show your sneakin’ face!”</p>

<p>“It’s healthier where I am,” said Dalsett, “but,
just to show you that we have the advantage&mdash;how’s
that?”</p>

<p>A shot followed his voice, and a twig was clipped
from the tree above Nestor’s head. Instinctively,
the miner ducked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ve got you surrounded,” went on Dalsett.
“You may have the mine, but we have you, and a
heap of good the claim will do you when you can’t
file your papers!”</p>

<p>In a rage, Nestor fired in the direction of the
voice, aiming high, as he did not wish to seriously
wound even an enemy when there seemed to be no
need. A mocking laugh followed. At the same
time there were several shots from different points
surrounding the camp, showing that it was indeed
encircled.</p>

<p>“It looks as if they had us, don’t it?” asked
Broswick.</p>

<p>“Not by a long shot!” replied Nestor, heartily.
“I’ve only just begun to play this here game. Before
I’m through I’ll make Noddy Nixon and Tom
Dalsett wish they’d never bothered me.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“Get breakfast,” answered Nestor, promptly.
“We’ll need food for what’s ahead of us.”</p>

<p>A stealthy movement in the bushes attracted his
attention.</p>

<p>“So that’s their plan, eh?” he murmured.
“Hank, take your gun and go up to the mouth of
the mine shaft. If any of that gang tries to approach,
shoot to wound but not to kill. They were
trying to sneak up to the mine and gain possession,”
explained Nestor, in reference to his directions to
the hunter. Broswick hurried up the slope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry and the other boys proceeded to get the
morning meal. As for Professor Snodgrass, he
was walking around, gathering specimens, as
though danger was a thousand miles away. Nestor,
with weapons ready, kept sharp watch.</p>

<p>They ate breakfast by turns, keeping a lookout
lest the enemy might attempt to rush the position.
But this did not seem to be the plan of the besiegers.
They were content to keep close watch so
that those in possession of the mine could not leave.</p>

<p>As an experiment, Nestor tried it. He walked a
little way down the valley. He had not proceeded
far before there was a spurt of dust at his feet and
a voice cried:</p>

<p>“Better go back, Jim. You’ll be all right as
long as you stay in bounds, but if you go out there’ll
be trouble; so I advise you to keep quiet.”</p>

<p>“Wait till I git hold of you, Tom Dalsett!”
cried the miner, shaking his fist in the direction of
his invisible foe.</p>

<p>“Oh, I expect to be here some time, so I’ll wait,”
was the reply, and Nestor could only turn back.</p>

<p>Just before noon the miner called a council of
war. He explained that it was very necessary for
him, or some one, to get to a Government office
and file a claim on the mine.</p>

<p>“It’s a case of first come, first served in this
minin’ business,” explained Nestor. “Those chaps
may be on the way now to register their papers, an’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
if they are we’ll lose the claim. I’ll bet that’s their
plan, an’ that’s why they’re keepin’ us cooped up
here!”</p>

<p>“How far is it to the Government office?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“A matter of thirty miles,” replied Nestor. “It’s
about five miles beyond where we turned up into
this valley. But what’s the use talkin’? We can’t
git away while they’re on guard with guns.”</p>

<p>“We all can’t, but one of us might,” suggested
Jerry.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that I will go and file the papers.”</p>

<p>“How will you manage it?”</p>

<p>Jerry explained his plan. Nestor nodded in approval,
and hurriedly told him how to comply with
the necessary legal forms. The miner hastily filled
out a paper, gave it to the boy, and remarked:</p>

<p>“Now we’ll try that trick of yours, Jerry.”</p>

<p>In accordance with the plan Jerry had proposed,
every one but himself started toward the top of the
hill where the mine shaft was located. Jerry
stayed near the automobile. The others took no
pains to move quietly, but laughed and talked.</p>

<p>Reaching the top of the slope, at a word from
Nestor, they made a rush down the other side, at
the same time firing their revolvers wildly in the
air.</p>

<p>As Jerry had expected, the ruse worked. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
force of besiegers, thinking an escape was being
attempted, ran around the other side of the hill to
intercept it. Led by Dalsett, Noddy and his crowd
drew up in the underbrush at the opposite foot of
the slope to trap the supposed fugitives.</p>

<p>At that instant Jerry sprang to the auto. Like
a flash he had the motor going, and a second later
he had leaped into the seat and was off down the
valley. A ringing cheer by his comrades, together
with the chugging of the motor, told the enemy
what had happened. They realized that they had
been fooled, and had been drawn away on a false
alarm.</p>

<p>“Quick! After him, Noddy!” cried Dalsett.
“Jump in your auto! You must overtake him before
he reaches the Government office, for he’s
going there to file the claim. That’s what we’d
ought to have done instead of monkeying here.”</p>

<p>Noddy needed no second bidding. His auto
stood ready a short distance down the valley. He
ran to it, started the motor, and was after Jerry in
a few minutes. It was another race for the possession
of the gold mine.</p>

<p>Returning to their camp, much pleased at the
success of their stratagem, Nestor, the boys and
Professor Snodgrass got dinner. Broswick was
still on guard at the shaft, but Nestor relieved the
hunter a little later, allowing him to eat and take
some rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the besiegers, they seemed to have settled
down to dogged waiting, for they gave no sign,
though an occasional movement in the underbrush
showed they were still on guard.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jerry and Noddy were racing on.
Jerry had a good start and sent his car along at a
fine speed. The road was rough, and several times
he struck large stones that caused the auto to
bounce unpleasantly.</p>

<p>Now and then Jerry would glance back to see
if his enemy was in sight. After a run of about
two miles he caught a glimpse of Noddy’s machine
coming after him.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll see who has the best car, and who is
the best driver,” reasoned Jerry, and his spirits
rose at the prospect of the race.</p>

<p>For several miles Jerry held his lead. Then he
noticed that Noddy was gaining slightly. Jerry
could feel that his motor was not running as
smoothly as it should, and no wonder, for it had
been through strenuous times. He used all his
skill in operating the various valves, gears, levers,
but, do the best he could, he saw Noddy slowly
though surely creeping up on him.</p>

<p>“He must not win!” exclaimed Jerry, fiercely, to
himself. Then, though it was a dangerous thing
to do, for the road was very rough, he opened the
gasolene throttle still wider, and the car bounded
forward at greater speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>This temporary advantage was soon lost, however,
and Noddy came on relentlessly. For an
hour the race continued. The autoists left the
small valley leading to the mine and turned into the
broad defile.</p>

<p>“Five miles more!” thought Jerry, recalling
Nestor’s directions.</p>

<p>The next instant, with a rush and rattle, Noddy’s
car came up alongside that of Jerry’s. They were
now on even terms.</p>

<p>“I s’pose you thought you’d beat me!” sneered
the bully.</p>

<p>“The race isn’t over yet,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>But in truth it looked as if it was, as far as
Jerry was concerned. Noddy gained inch by inch,
until his car was a good length ahead. The bully
looked back with a mocking smile.</p>

<p>One mile was reeled off, and but four remained
of the distance to the little town where the Government
office was located. Another mile; then
another. Noddy’s car was now five hundred feet
ahead, and Jerry was running his machine as fast
as he dared, though not to the limit.</p>

<p>There remained but another mile as the cars
shot into a long, straight stretch. In the distance
Jerry could see a small town. Noddy was an eighth
of a mile in advance.</p>

<p>“I’m going to lose!” exclaimed Jerry, and he felt
his heart sink.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a><br />
<small>WINNING THE CLAIM.</small></h2>


<p>There was but half a mile more. The two autos
were now on the outskirts of the settlement, and
men gathered in the single main street to watch
the race.</p>

<p>Suddenly Noddy’s car skidded and he was forced
to shut off the power. This allowed Jerry to gain
a little. He quickly saw his chance. Resolving to
risk everything, he turned on full speed and pressed
down the accelerator pedal.</p>

<p>His car lurched forward with such suddenness
that the youth was almost pitched from his seat.
But he caught up to Noddy. The latter saw the
advantage that had been gained and tried a desperate
measure.</p>

<p>Turning his steering wheel he swerved his auto
over toward Jerry’s, intending to strike him a
glancing blow and upset him.</p>

<p>But Jerry was too quick for him. He got out
of the way, though only just in time. Then he
glanced up and saw, about one hundred feet in advance,
a white building, with a sign reading:</p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Government Assay Office.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>He brought up his machine with a jerk by applying
the emergency brake. Almost before it stopped
he leaped out, but his coat caught on the steering
wheel and he fell in the dusty road.</p>

<p>At that instant Noddy dashed up in his machine.
He was quick to see what had befallen Jerry, and
like a flash was out of his car, and, with a proof
of claim in his hand, he rushed for the door of the
assay office.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” yelled Jerry, springing to his
feet.</p>

<p>He took after Noddy and caught him just as
the bully was about to enter the office. But one
thought flashed through Jerry’s mind. He must
beat Noddy.</p>

<p>He drew back his fist and, with a powerful blow
that caught the bully right on the chin, sent him
sprawling away from the doorway and into the
dusty street.</p>

<p>“I want to file this claim,” panted Jerry, an instant
later, handing the astonished Government
clerk the proof Nestor had made out. The boy
had done the only thing possible under the circumstances
to enable him to get into the office. He
had knocked Noddy aside and gone in ahead of
him, winning by the margin of a second.</p>

<p>The commotion caused by the two automobiles
racing into town, the conduct of the two boys, and
Jerry’s action had attracted quite a crowd about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
assay office. People fairly filled the rough shack
in which the agents of Uncle Sam did business, and
the claim clerk was so startled by the suddenness
of the whole transaction that he stood motionless.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to file and record that
claim?” asked Jerry, looking out of the window
and seeing Noddy limp to his feet.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know&mdash;of course I am&mdash;that
is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He isn’t goin’ to do anythin’ until I have somethin’
to say,” interrupted a rough voice. “I’m
sheriff of this county, an’ I’d have you automobilists
know that you can’t come here lickity split an’
not pay the damage. I’ll arrest you both for exceedin’
the speed limits.”</p>

<p>“What is the legal limit?” asked Jerry, anxious
only about getting his paper filed.</p>

<p>“Seventy miles an hour.”</p>

<p>“My machine can’t make over fifty if I was to
run it at full speed on a beach track,” replied Jerry,
hotly.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;er&mdash;maybe I’m a leetle off on figgers,”
admitted the sheriff. “It may be seven miles, but
you’re both arrested&mdash;er&mdash;um&mdash;fer disturbin’ the
peace. There, I guess you can’t git around that.
I may be a leetle mite hazy on law, but I ain’t on
fact. Do you deny that you disturbed the peace?”
and he turned to Jerry.</p>

<p>“I admit I knocked him down,” said the boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
nodding toward the bully, who was entering the
room. “I’m willing to pay a fine for that if I may
file this paper. How much do I owe you?”</p>

<p>“We can’t do business in that loose way,” spoke
the sheriff, with a great sense of his own importance.
“This must go through a regular form.
You’ll both have to go before the judge. I’ll arrest
you both.”</p>

<p>“But can’t I file this paper?” insisted Jerry.
“You can arrest me just the same.”</p>

<p>“One thing at a time,” went on the sheriff. “You
come with me; let the judge hear the case, an’ if
he finds you not guilty you can come back here an’
file fifty papers if you want to. But you can’t
now, an’ I forbid this clerk to take any papers
from anybody until I come back.”</p>

<p>Jerry fretted at the delay. It was easy to see
that in this rough, western town the authority of
the sheriff was paramount. At first Jerry thought
it might be a trick put up to benefit Noddy, but
when he saw the bully was not allowed to file
his papers either, he became convinced that the
sheriff thought he was acting within his legal
rights.</p>

<p>Followed by a big crowd, the officer led his two
prisoners toward the rude shanty where the judge
held court as often as it was necessary. Noddy
was plainly in a great rage, but Jerry took it all as
good-naturedly as he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“You wait till Pud Stoneham and Tom Dalsett
hear of this!” blustered Noddy to the sheriff.
“They’ll make trouble, for they told me to be sure
and file that paper as soon as I could.”</p>

<p>“What names did you say?” asked the sheriff.</p>

<p>Noddy repeated them.</p>

<p>“I’d give a good bit to see Pud Stoneham just
now,” remarked the officer, in a peculiar voice.
“But I guess he don’t want to see me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you where you can find him,” spoke
Jerry, quickly, surmising how the land lay.</p>

<p>“Where? Tell me, quick, boy! Are you tryin’
to fool me?”</p>

<p>In a few words Jerry told about the mine, and
how he had left his friends besieged there by the
gambler and his companions.</p>

<p>“It’s our mine, and I tried to file the claim before
Noddy Nixon did,” finished Jerry.</p>

<p>“And you’ll do it yet,” said the sheriff, heartily.
“Here,” he called to the crowd, which came to a
halt, “this case is adjourned indefinitely.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t there goin’ to be a trial?” asked several,
disappointed in what they thought would furnish
excitement.</p>

<p>“Not now,” replied the officer. “This boy,
Jerry Hopkins, is paroled in my custody. Noddy
Nixon is paroled in the custody of Bill Lamson, an’
I’ll appoint you a special deputy for the occasion,
Bill. You take charge of Noddy until sundown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
when you kin let him go. An’, mind, if he escapes
I’ll court-martial you, Bill.”</p>

<p>“He won’t git away,” said the new deputy, confidently.</p>

<p>The crowd had already begun to disperse, finding
there was to be nothing to interest them. Lamson
went away with Noddy, who vainly protested
against being detained.</p>

<p>“Now take me to Pud Stoneham,” said the
sheriff to Jerry. “I’ve been lookin’ for him for
’most a month. He’s wanted for a dozen crimes.
Well, well, this is luck!”</p>

<p>“What about filing the claim?” asked Jerry, not
losing sight of his important mission.</p>

<p>“You kin attend to that right off,” was the answer.
“Then take me to the mine an’ I’ll attend to
Pud Stoneham.”</p>

<p>Jerry lost no time in filing a formal proof of
claim to the mine, and saw the record made in the
Government books. Then, with a lighter heart
than he had known for many a day, feeling that
at least part of the hard work was over, he went to
the auto, where the sheriff was waiting.</p>

<p>“I’ll take you out in the car,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’d a heap sight rather have a mule,” commented
the officer, eyeing the machine with a suspicious
glance, “but I s’pose this is quicker. Don’t
upset, now.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” promised Jerry. “But, Mr. Sheriff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
hadn’t you better take some help along? Pud and
Dalsett are well armed.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. I’ll swear in a couple of deputies,”
said the officer. “Here, you,” he called to two
men passing by, “come with me, I may need you.
Hold up your right hands. You swear to do whatever
I tell you to, all right. I owe you fifty cents
apiece, but you’ll have to git change. Never mind
now, jump in the shebang. We’re after a man.”</p>

<p>Then the sheriff paused to take a much-needed
breath. The two men, who didn’t seem surprised
at being so suddenly called on to act, took their
places in the machine and Jerry started off.</p>

<p>He exulted in his success, for he knew that, no
matter what happened now, the mine stood in the
names of Nestor and the adventurers, including
himself. All that now remained was to get the
gold out.</p>

<p>Jerry sent the machine along at a good clip.
Mile after mile was covered and at last the auto
turned up the little valley leading to the mine. As
the machine neared the hill in which the shaft was
sunk a sound of firing was heard.</p>

<p>“They’re fighting!” cried the boy, as he increased
the speed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a><br />
<small>THE FIGHT AT THE MINE.</small></h2>


<p>As the auto came near, the shots became more
distinct. It seemed as if a small-sized battle was
in progress. Jerry stopped the car about a thousand
feet away from where the camp had been.</p>

<p>“Take it easy until we see where we’re at,” advised
the sheriff. “There’s too many bullets flyin’
around for comfort.”</p>

<p>He got out of the machine and began creeping
along on the ground on hands and knees. His
deputies followed his example, and Jerry thought
it well to do likewise.</p>

<p>It was soon evident that an attack was being
made on the hill, where the forces of Nestor
seemed to have entrenched themselves. Stoneham,
Dalsett, Berry and Pender were drawing nearer
under cover of the underbrush and were firing as
they advanced. Nestor and his crowd were replying
with shot after shot, though most of the bullets
were high in the air.</p>

<p>“If I could only get a line on where they are,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
muttered the sheriff, “I’d be all right, but I can’t
see a thing in these bushes.”</p>

<p>All at once the firing from the top of the hill
ceased.</p>

<p>“I guess they’re out of ammunition,” said Jerry.
“They didn’t have very much when I came away.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s time we did somethin’,” remarked the
sheriff. “There, I see ’em now. Come on, boys!”</p>

<p>The two deputies followed him on the run, and
Jerry kept as close as he could.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sheriff came to a halt. He motioned
with his hand for the others to keep quiet.
Then the officer began creeping at a slow pace.
He halted once more and waved to the others to
approach. They did so with all the caution possible.</p>

<p>“We’ve got ’em!” exclaimed the sheriff. “Pud
Stoneham and the rest of ’em are down in a little
hollow just below us. They are gettin’ ready to
make a rush, I think.”</p>

<p>Peering over the edge of a little bluff on which
the sheriff’s party stood, Jerry looked down and
saw the gambler, Bill Berry and Jack Pender, each
with a revolver, crouching down and peering forward.
They were within a few hundred feet of
the shaft, and Jerry could dimly observe Nestor
and his friends grouped about the mine.</p>

<p>They seemed to be making a last stand. The
truth of the matter was that, as Jerry had surmised,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
they were out of ammunition and could no longer
reply to the fusillade that Stoneham and his crowd
kept up. For a time there was a lull in the
firing.</p>

<p>Then the shots began again, coming from Stoneham,
Berry and Pender. But they did not seem to
be aiming to kill or even wound those guarding the
mine. Desperate as the gambler was, and great
as was his wish to get the gold claim, he would not
resort to extreme measures. So he and the others
were firing over the heads of those they were attacking.
They hoped to scare them away.</p>

<p>If they could do this, and rush in, securing possession
of the claim, they would, under the mining
laws, provided that Noddy had filed the claim,
be masters of the situation. But something was
about to happen.</p>

<p>The sheriff was watching Stoneham like a cat.
The gambler and his friends were unaware how
close they were to danger, and continued to fire
above the heads of the party at the shaft.</p>

<p>From their point of vantage the sheriff, his deputies
and Jerry watched what was going on below
them. They saw Nestor, Broswick and the others
waver, for the firing was hot, and they did not
know it was a harmless one.</p>

<p>“Come on!” yelled Stoneham, suddenly. “We’ve
got ’em! Come on, an’ take the mine!”</p>

<p>The gambler leaped to his feet, flourishing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
revolver. Pender, Berry and Dalsett prepared to
follow him.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” cried the sheriff.</p>

<p>The officer leaped forward, over the bluff, and
shot downward. Full and true he fell, right on
the back of Stoneham, bearing him to the earth.</p>

<p>“I say! What’s this? Oh, let me up!” yelled
the gambler.</p>

<p>“Not until I’ve fixed you so’s you can’t do any
damage!” exclaimed the officer, drawing out a pair
of handcuffs and fastening them on Stoneham.</p>

<p>The gambler struggled hard for a few seconds.
Then, finding it was of no avail, he lay quietly
at the sheriff’s feet.</p>

<p>“Where’d you come from?” he asked the officer.</p>

<p>“Oh, I took a little run up here in one of them
new-fangled gasolene gigs,” replied the sheriff,
with a grin. “I heard you were up here an’ I felt
I couldn’t get along without havin’ a little conversation
with you.”</p>

<p>“Um!” grunted Stoneham.</p>

<p>Dalsett disappeared into the bushes at the instant
the sheriff had jumped on the gambler’s back,
and was soon lost to sight.</p>

<p>“Never mind him,” said the officer, when he saw
that capture was not possible. “I didn’t want him,
anyhow. It was Pud I was after, an’ I got him.”</p>

<p>“What’ll we do with this lad?” asked one of
the deputies who had grabbed Pender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pl-pl-please don’t ki-kill me!” cried the boy, a
coward, now that his side had lost.</p>

<p>“Kill you!” exclaimed the sheriff. “The worst
that’ll happen to you will be a good spankin’.
That’s what we do to babies out here!”</p>

<p>Pender showed no inclination to escape, nor did
Bill Berry, who stood sullenly to one side.</p>

<p>“Get up!” the sheriff commanded Stoneham,
and the gambler struggled to his feet. His air of
bravado was gone and he hung his head. “I’ll take
you back to town in a little while,” the officer announced.</p>

<p>There was a crackling in the bushes and, cautiously
parting them, Nestor stepped into view.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” he asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” replied the boy. “I filed the
claim, I beat Noddy, and this is the sheriff, who
has arrested Mr. Stoneham.”</p>

<p>“Good for you!” cried the miner. “We’ve been
havin’ a pretty lively time since you went away, an’
you got back just in time. So the papers are filed,
eh? Well, that gives us the mine now, an’ we’re
all rich!”</p>

<p>“I’d rather have Mr. Stoneham here than a gold
mine,” remarked the sheriff.</p>

<p>“Is he so valuable?” asked Nestor.</p>

<p>“He is to me,” was the answer. “There’s a reward
of five thousand dollars for his capture for
counterfeitin’ money, an’ besides that he’s wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
on half a dozen charges. When I heard he was
here, I jest hustled, I tell you.”</p>

<p>It was getting dusk now, and, after a little
thought, the sheriff decided not to take his prisoner
back to town that night.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, I’ll camp out here with
you,” the officer said to Nestor, and the miner extended
a hearty invitation. Soon supper was prepared
and partaken of sitting around the camp-fire.</p>

<p>Stoneham’s hands were unshackled long enough
to enable him to eat, but the sheriff guarded him
closely. He was not going to have his captive escape
if he could help it. Pender and Berry ate in
dogged silence.</p>

<p>After supper, when the men had lighted their
pipes, Nestor told the sheriff the story of the trip
to the gold mine. The official was much interested.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing you have the claim to your
mine filed,” he said. “I understand there’s a great
rush of diggers this way. They were at Eagleville
yesterday, a town about twenty miles from here,
and I expect they’ll be stragglin’ in here to-morrow.
Whenever there’s news of a gold strike the
miners are on the trail like a hound after a fox.”</p>

<p>The moon rose over the trees and made the glow
of the camp-fire seem like a tallow candle beside
an electric light. The forest was flooded with the
radiance and it was almost as bright as day.</p>

<p>“I could almost go out and gather some specimens,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
remarked Professor Snodgrass, who had
said little since the exciting events of the afternoon.</p>

<p>“What do you want most?” asked the sheriff.</p>

<p>“I’d like to get&mdash;look out, there! Don’t move
for the life of you! Wait until I get my net!”
cried the professor, suddenly, staring at something
close to the officer.</p>

<p>“What is it, a rattlesnake?” asked the sheriff,
somewhat alarmed at the professor’s excitement.</p>

<p>“Don’t move! Don’t move!” was all the naturalist
replied.</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s a snake you can bet your boots I
won’t stir until you’ve got it,” answered the sheriff.
“I seen a man bit by one once and he didn’t last
half an hour. But say, my friend, don’t be any
longer than you can help. It’s sort of a strain on
my nerves, you know.”</p>

<p>“Softly! Easy!” spoke the professor.</p>

<p>He had his net now and was tiptoeing up to
where the officer sat, close beside Stoneham.</p>

<p>“There!” cried the professor, slapping the
meshes down on the ground. “I’ve got him!”</p>

<p>“Have you got the rattlesnake?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Rattlesnake?” inquired the naturalist, gathering
something carefully in the folds of the net.
“Who said anything about a snake? I’ve just captured
a white lizard, one of the rarest that exists.
It’s worth one thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed the sheriff, “it nearly scared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
me to that amount, the way you acted. I thought
sure I was goin’ to be hit by a snake.”</p>

<p>After the excitement, unintentionally caused by
the professor, had quieted down, and he had put
his lizard away with his other specimens, it was
voted time to turn in. Blankets were brought from
the automobile to serve as coverings, and the fire
was replenished.</p>

<p>In order to be sure his prisoner would not escape,
the sheriff tied Stoneham to a big tree. As an additional
precaution the officer passed one end of
the rawhide thong about his own arm, so that the
slightest movement on the gambler’s part would be
noted.</p>

<p>Then Nestor, who agreed to take the first watch,
began pacing up and down in front of the camp,
while the others fell asleep.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a><br />
<small>AN ESCAPE&mdash;CONCLUSION.</small></h2>


<p>At midnight Nestor awoke Broswick, who was
to take the next watch.</p>

<p>“All quiet?” asked the hunter.</p>

<p>“As a churchyard,” replied the miner.</p>

<p>“How about Berry and Pender?”</p>

<p>“They haven’t moved.”</p>

<p>“All right; turn in.”</p>

<p>Nestor was soon snoring, and Broswick began
his vigil. The moon began to move over toward
the west, and the only sounds heard were the hoots
of owls or the barking of foxes.</p>

<p>Suddenly the hunter paused in his walk about the
camp. His trained ear told him somebody or something
was approaching. He could hear the breaking
of twigs and the rattle of stones as they were
stepped on.</p>

<p>“That’s a human being,” decided the hunter.
“No animal would be as clumsy as that in making
an approach.”</p>

<p>He waited, with his rifle ready.</p>

<p>“If it’s some one coming to rescue Stoneham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
they’ll get a warm reception,” he whispered to himself.</p>

<p>The noise came nearer. Then the bushes off to
the left parted cautiously, and Broswick heard a
soft whisper:</p>

<p>“Hey, Bill! Hey, Jack! Where are you?”</p>

<p>“It’s that Noddy Nixon chap,” Broswick muttered.
“He must have come back in his automobile
after the deputy sheriff released him at sundown.
Now I wonder what I’d better do?”</p>

<p>“Hey, Bill!” Noddy called, in a little louder
whisper, “can you sneak away? I have the machine
ready.”</p>

<p>This time a movement near where Bill Berry
and Pender were lying told that they had heard
the summons. Broswick silently drew back into
the shadows and waited to see what would happen.
He did not think it necessary to arouse the others
yet.</p>

<p>Berry rose to his feet and peered about him.
Jack followed. They were trying to locate Noddy’s
whereabouts.</p>

<p>“Here I am!” whispered Noddy. “Right by
the oak tree.”</p>

<p>As quietly as they could, Pender and Berry began
sneaking off to one side, avoiding the light cast
by the camp-fire.</p>

<p>“Shall I let ’em go or stop ’em?” debated Broswick
with himself. “Guess I’ll let ’em go. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
don’t want ’em, for they’re more trouble than
they’re worth. But I’ll give ’em a good scare.”</p>

<p>He raised his gun and fired two shots in the air,
over the heads of the escaping man and boy. Their
frightened yells told how startled they were.</p>

<p>In an instant the camp was in confusion. Every
one awoke, Nestor standing ready with a revolver
in either hand.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Only Noddy coming back for his two friends,”
replied Broswick.</p>

<p>“Have they escaped?”</p>

<p>The hunter raised his hand to indicate silence.
A crashing of the underbrush told in which way
the fugitives were heading.</p>

<p>“There they go,” said Broswick.</p>

<p>The sheriff had quickly assured himself that
Stoneham was still securely bound.</p>

<p>“Shall we take after Noddy and Pender?” asked
Broswick.</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” asked Nestor. “If we had
them arrested it would only make trouble for us.
Let ’em go. I got some of my gold back from
Pender.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let ’em go,” assented Jerry.</p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>All listened. The faint chugging of an automobile
was heard, gradually dying away in the distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess that’s the end of ’em,” remarked
Nestor.</p>

<p>Once more quiet settled down on the camp, and
there were no other disturbances that night. The
shining of the sun through the trees awoke the
campers, and soon coffee was made and a simple
breakfast ready.</p>

<p>“Now if one of you will run down to town in
the automobile, with me and my friend Stoneham
here,” said the sheriff, “I’ll be obliged to
you.”</p>

<p>Jerry agreed to make the trip, and Nestor said
he would go along, as he wanted to do some business
at the Government Assay Office. The mine
was left in charge of Broswick, Professor Snodgrass,
Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>“Don’t let anybody jump the claim,” cautioned
the miner with a laugh, as he rode off, Jerry steering
the automobile down the valley.</p>

<p>“There’ll be trouble if they try it,” said the
hunter, looking at his gun.</p>

<p>No accidents occurred during the automobile
trip. Town was safely reached, and the sheriff
lodged his prisoner in jail. Nestor transacted his
business with the Government agent, and then
Jerry headed the machine back for the camp. There
they found everything in good shape.</p>

<p>“Now that our troubles are about over, an’
we’re in possession of our mine, it won’t be a bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
idea to dig out a few nuggets for luck,” said
Nestor.</p>

<p>“Can we have one?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Why, sure, Chunky,” replied the miner. “The
claim’s part yours, jest as it is mine. We’re goin’
to share an’ share alike in this deal. I’d never have
got to this mine if it hadn’t been for you boys.
Have a nugget? Well, I guess yes.”</p>

<p>They went to the top of the hill, and Nestor and
Jerry descended the shaft. This second trip more
than confirmed the first view of the richness of the
mine. The rocky sides of the shaft were fairly
studded with small nuggets. Nestor dug out some
with his knife, and Jerry did likewise.</p>

<p>“There’s about one hundred dollars,” remarked
the miner after half an hour’s work, showing a
handful of dull, golden pebbles. Jerry had about
the same amount.</p>

<p>“Now we’ve got to git ready to work this claim,”
said Nestor. “I’ll attend to all that, seein’ as how
I’m familiar with the business. But, first, we’ll
go up an’ show the others what we have.”</p>

<p>As they neared the top of the shaft they heard
quite a commotion on the surface. The voices of
men in dispute could be heard.</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s the trouble now?” Nestor
said.</p>

<p>Coming out of the shaft he found the summit of
the hill surrounded by fifty or more roughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
dressed men, all bearing mining tools on their
backs. They stood in a circle while Broswick, with
cocked rifle, was holding them at bay.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Nestor.</p>

<p>“They allowed they was goin’ to jump this
claim,” said the hunter.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, pardner,” spoke one of the crowd,
who seemed to be a sort of leader, addressing his
remarks to Nestor. “I take it you’re in charge
here?”</p>

<p>“That’s what,” replied the miner.</p>

<p>“Waal, we ain’t goin’ to jump nobody’s claim.
We’re a bunch of miners, an’ we’ve come all the
way from Spread Eagle Valley to this region,
hearin’ as how there was good claims here. Are
we right?”</p>

<p>“You be,” replied Nestor, “an’ you’re welcome.
There’s the stakes of our claim,” and he indicated
them.</p>

<p>“All filed reg’lar an’ ’cordin’ to law, I s’pose?”
went on the spokesman.</p>

<p>“Right,” answered Nestor. “You can locate
anywhere you like outside of my claim.”</p>

<p>“That’s all we wanted to know,” went on the
other. “Come on, boys!” he called to his companions.
“It’s all right!”</p>

<p>The whole valley was soon a scene of great activity,
with miners staking claims on every side.
They were eager with the desire for gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Within a week the whole region fairly swarmed
with the gold seekers, for the section was rich with
the precious metal. But no claim was as valuable
as that of the lost mine which Nestor and the boys
had found.</p>

<p>Arrangements were made for working the claim,
machinery was ordered, and soon pay-dirt was
being taken out in large quantities. A more comfortable
log cabin was erected in place of the rude
shack that served as a temporary shelter, and the
boys began to enjoy life in the new diggings.</p>

<p>One of the first things they had done when they
were sure of the possession of the mine was to
write back home and tell their parents of the good
luck.</p>

<p>Jerry suggested that in the missives each one
should ask permission to remain at the gold mine
for some time longer, and perhaps make a further
trip before returning to Cresville.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we’ll get any letters by this mail?”
asked Ned one evening, when, after the day’s work
was done, they all sat about the camp-fire.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon know,” said Jerry. “Here comes
Nestor back from town, and it looks as if he had
something in his hand.”</p>

<p>The miner approached, riding Broswick’s horse.</p>

<p>“Here’s the postman!” he cried, waving some
papers in the air. “Letters for each of ye!”</p>

<p>Three anxious boys opened three envelopes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
soon were busy reading the missives. Then came
three simultaneous whoops of delight.</p>

<p>“I can stay!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“Me, too!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“And me!” came from Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame your folks for lettin’ ye stay,”
put in Nestor. “You’re makin’ money here every
day out of this mine.”</p>

<p>The parents of the boys had wisely concluded
that it would be a good experience for their sons
to develop the mine further, since they seemed to
be in good hands under Nestor’s guidance, and
able to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>“We’ll have no end of good times,” said Bob,
trying to turn a handspring on the grass, but
tumbling down in the effort.</p>

<p>“I’d feel better if I was sure we had seen the
last of Noddy and Pender, as well as Bill Berry
and that Dalsett chap,” spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll never bother us again,” came from
Ned. “They’re running like scared rabbits. We’ll
never see them again.”</p>

<p>But Ned was wrong. They did meet Noddy
and his three companions once more, and under
strange circumstances, as will be related in the next
volume of this series, to be entitled “The Motor
Boys in Mexico; or, The Secret of the Buried
City.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go to bed,” suggested Jerry, as the camp-fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
died out. And they went to their bunks in the
log cabin as the moon rose over the trees and cast
a silver gleam over the machinery at the shaft of
the gold mine.</p>

<p>The Motor Boys’ trip overland had panned out
very well, indeed.</p>
